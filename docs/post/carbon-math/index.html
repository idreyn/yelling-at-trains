			<h1>Green new wheels</h1>
			<i><time>February 24, 2019</time></i>
			<div>
				

<p>For a few weeks each year or so, often coinciding with the latest climate accords or emergency summit, the United States collectively kicks around the idea of saving the planet. In early 2019 this intriguing idea is once again having a moment thanks to a group of climate activists loosely organizing around the idea of a &ldquo;Green New Deal&rdquo; to nudge the economy towards carbon-neutrality over the next few decades. As usual, emissions from transportation are at the forefront of the conversation, perhaps because watching the exhaust from our tailpipes is one of the few times we actually see ourselves add carbon to the atmosphere. Or perhaps it&rsquo;s because transportation accounts for 28.1% of the United States&rsquo; energy usage, more than any other category.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>(H) overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible, including through investment in &ndash;</em></p>

<p><em>(i) zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing;</em></p>

<p><em>(ii) clean, affordable, and accessible public transit; and</em></p>

<p><em>(iii) high-speed rail;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>The Green New Deal movement, which aims to legislate the United States towards carbon-neutrality over the next few decades</li>
<li>The public admission from California governor Gavin Newsom that the state&rsquo;s high speed rail link between San Francisco and Los Angeles may never actually link those two cities</li>
<li>In personal news, a new job requiring more air travel that has really blown up my personal carbon footprint</li>
</ul>

<p>Air travel is not good for the environment, but there&rsquo;s no viable alternative to the energy density of carbon-based jet fuel without breakthrough battery technology (or someone building a nuclear-powered plane). So long as we hurdle ourselves across the globe in pretzel-filled aluminum tubes, we&rsquo;re going to do so by adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere for the forseeable future. Thus, air travel receives lots of attention every time we collectively consider saving our planet for a few weeks. But should it?</p>

<h2 id="trains-are-nuclear-buses-are-solar">Trains are nuclear, buses are solar</h2>

<p>It was once said that nuclear power in America would be &ldquo;too cheap to meter&rdquo; &ndash; that power plants going online would quickly blanket the country in abundant, carbon-free electricity. Today, we&rsquo;ve fallen far short of that world, and the United States gets around 8.5% of its energy from nuclear fission, compared to about 28% from natural gas.</p>

<p>The point to stress here is not that high-speed rail is bad. I actually think trains are really good and in fact I run a little blog about them. But a serious rail network is</p>

<p>The other galaxy-brained point that I want to make here is simply that the United States is extremely big, which affects our living and travel patterns at many scales. From the regularity of cross-country airline travel to the massive sprawl of many of our cities, the embiggenment of this nation has given us lots of room to spread out, and thus lots of miles to travel in the course of our lives.</p>
