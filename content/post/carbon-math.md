For a few weeks each year or so, often coinciding with the latest climate accords, emergency summit, or wildfire, the United States collectively kicks around the idea of saving the planet. In early 2019 this intriguing idea is once again having a moment thanks to a group of climate activists organizing around the idea of a Green New Deal to nudge the economy towards carbon-neutrality. As usual, emissions from transportation are at the forefront of the conversation, perhaps because seeing the exhaust from our tailpipes is one of the few times we actually watch ourselves add carbon to the atmosphere. Or perhaps it's because transportation accounts for 28.1% of the United States' energy usage, more than any other category.

While the Green New Deal has a long way to go before it can be massaged into a set of tax breaks for mildly repentant oil companies and eventually passed into law, it's refreshing to see folks in government proposing solutions that at least acknowledge the scale of the problem. But even from the sketch of a proposal put before Congress, it's clear that our thinking on the issue of transportation emissions needs to evolve further before we're ready to commit to spending oodles of money to solve the problem. Specifically, the proposal calls for investment in the following areas:

1. zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing
2. clean, affordable, and accessible public transit
3. high-speed rail

...

## High-speed rail as a carbon-mitigation technology

High speed rail had something of a moment after a leaked draft of a Green New Deal FAQ

Airplanes are to the atmosphere what hookah is to your lungs, and finding out what a single cross-country flight does to your carbon footprint is like being told that you just smoked the equivalent of like a hundred cigarettes on your trip through the back room. Unfortunately, air travel requires fuels with an energy density that current battery technology can't really touch, so hurding ourselves across the globe in pretzel-filled aluminum tubes will mean adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere for the forseeable future.

A clear and compelling alternative to air travel is high-speed rail. Everyone who backpacked through Europe or Asia in their 20s comes home for Thanksgiving full of wild tales of sleek, comfortable trains that make cars on adjacent freeways look like they're standing still, and in between mouthfuls of cranberry sauce there's general assent that it would be cool as heck if the government could get its act together and build some of that here.[^1] It's true that the United States is just too big for HSR to compete with air travel on cross-country flights -- a 

## Trains are nuclear, buses are solar

Air travel is not good for the environment, but there's no viable alternative to the energy density of carbon-based jet fuel without breakthrough battery technology (or someone building a nuclear-powered plane). So long as we hurdle ourselves across the globe in pretzel-filled aluminum tubes, we're going to do so by adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere for the forseeable future. Thus, air travel receives lots of attention every time we collectively consider saving our planet for a few weeks. But should it?

Listen, I love trains. Occasionally, and to my great chagrin, I am introduced at parties as "the trains guy".

It was once said that nuclear power in America would be "too cheap to meter" -- that power plants going online would quickly blanket the country in abundant, carbon-free electricity. Today, we've fallen far short of that world, and the United States gets around 8.5% of its energy from nuclear fission, compared to about 28% from natural gas.

The point to stress here is not that high-speed rail is bad. I actually think trains are really good and in fact I run a little blog about them. But a serious rail network is

The other galaxy-brained point that I want to make here is simply that the United States is extremely big, which affects our living and travel patterns at many scales. From the regularity of cross-country airline travel to the massive sprawl of many of our cities, the embiggenment of this nation has given us lots of room to spread out, and thus lots of miles to travel in the course of our lives.
