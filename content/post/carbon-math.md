Thanks in part to some actually good legislators and a group of young people concerned about the implending death of this planet, an audacious plan to make the United States carbon-neutral has found its way into the national spotlight in the form of the Green New Deal. As a person who hopes to survive well into the latter half of this century and -- on balance -- enjoys being alive, I'm thrilled that we (they) are heave-hoing the Overton window towards the kind of drastic action necessary to make a dent in the problem of climate change. While we wait for this audacious proposal to be reified by President Cory Booker into a series of tax breaks for Exxon Mobil to incorporate a baby harp seal into their logo, let's zoom in on some of the language in the proposal around transportation. Let me just figure out how to paste text out of a PDF, ok, here you go:

>   _(i) zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing;_
>   
>   _(ii) clean, affordable, and accessible public transit; and_
>   
>   _(iii) high-speed rail;_

The other galaxy-brained point that I want to make here is simply that the United States is extremely big, which affects our living and travel patterns at many scales. From the regularity of cross-country airline travel to the massive sprawl of many of our cities, the embiggenment of this nation has given us lots of room to spread out, and thus lots of miles to travel in the course of our lives.
