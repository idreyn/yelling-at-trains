For a long time I have been very vocal about transportation issues to my very forgiving friends and family. I've decided that rather than subject them to this madness directly I should start a blog -- this will also serve to help me practice writing clearly and organize my thoughts. I suspect this blog will mostly stay related to transit and urbanism since I spent so much time on the wonderful graphic in the header, but we'll see what becomes of it. Welcome aboard!
