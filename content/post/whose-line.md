People frequently ask me why I’m such a weirdo about public transportation. Frankly I think the most honest answer is that I was imprinted on it by spending too much time with model trains as a kid [1]. Then there the little things that I actually enjoy about it — all the Helvetica, the ever-present peanut-ozone smell of the MBTA tunnels, the fascinating layers of history behind station names. But when I think about why I’d actually want to devote a career to it, I have a well-formed and unusually sober answer. Public transportation lies at a fascinating intersection between engineering concerns and social problems. When they’re solved well, it creates access; people can meet people, take jobs, and experience things that would otherwise be less accessible or unavailable. It gives people time back in their days from their commutes. It creates a context in which people from different walks of life see and acknowledge each other. I guess once, an old woman met Jay-Z on the subway?

What I’m saying is that planning transit is the closest thing I can imagine to actually getting to implement positive liberty for people. I took the same intro philosophy class in college that you did, so I won’t condescend too hard about definitions here, but there’s a powerful distinction to be made between negative liberty, or freedom from interference with achieving your aims, and positive liberty, which is actually having the means to achieve your aims. The broadest goal of well-planned transit (and, implicitly, well-planned land use) is to give as wide a set of people the ability to achieve as wide a set of aims as possible — from going to the grocery store to spending time with family to attending school. Regardless of how much you value the idea of positive liberty, or what right to it you, the webmaster of libertarian.org, believe people should have, it seems uncontroversial to posit that the most positive liberty per dollar spent [2] is the outcome we should be aiming for when putting buses on the streets or trains under — god, not on!  — the avenues.

And yet, the astute reader has already pushed their glasses all the way up their nose and well onto their forehead and noted that — surely — the story really just begins here. It’s not just about how much liberty you’re providing, but also to whom and through what distributive framework. Pat yourself on the back, astute reader! This is what this blog post is about.

## In Which There Is Neither Enough Transit Or Enough Housing

Unless you’re living under a rock [2], you’e probably aware that it is Very Expensive to live in major American cities — more so than ever before. Our cities have survived a 20th century of neglect, white flight, underinvestment, and urban renewal and are now seen as models for a desirable lifestyle. Of course as an urbanist twitter bro that makes me very happy. The only problem is that this boom in private investment has not dragged along with it commensurate public investment in transit and housing. So we’re left in a situation where many more people are flocking to cities than we have housing for, and as people compete for housing, some are gradually pushed farther and farther to the outskirts of the region, outside the reaches of useful rapid transit.

While the solution to this seems blindingly obvious — just build more transit and housing, and put one near the other! — transforming sprawling, car-oriented cities into walkable places connected by transit is a generational project. Even with a 12-digit budget like the one LA bought itself with Measure M, we still need to choose what kind of transit projects are completed where and in what order. In the meantime

## I'd like you to meet my good friend TOD

The best rapid transit plan is a good land use plan, which is to say that it’s easiest to build transit in walkable, urban places. In America, though, light-rail projects are often built across sprawling metropolises, running through neighborhoods of all kinds on the way from downtown to the airport or whatever. In an effort to kickstart a real neighborhood in these places, dense housing and retail developments are often planned near these intermediate stations — a phenomenon we call Transit Oriented Development or TOD. For some transit projects, TOD is a value-add; for others, it borders on being the justification for building the whole thing. Regardless, American TOD tends to look anomalous in its larger context; usually consisting of apartment buildings in the “cookie cutter” glass and aluminum style that everyone seems to hate, with new retail catering to the kind of professional who you’d expect to live there. Because TOD usually relies on an exception to the local zoning code, it’s also built markedly taller than the surrounding blocks.

As a result, TOD usually looks like an invasive species. Even when well-planned, it has the whiff of the kind of development that heralds the end of affordability in a neighborhood, and the intrustion of goat yoga studios, driftwood jewelry botiques, and a food critic gingerly dispatched by the local paper to declare the neighborhood safe for white people. And because of the sheer number of shiny new units that it brings, TOD can easily raise the average price of an apartment in a neighborhood. At its worst, TOD is the physical embodiement of the anti-development strawman that wantonly displaces a whole neighborhood full of regular people to make room for young professionals who kinda want to take the train sometimes.

{{<figure src="/images/todd.png" caption="Pictured: Todd near Los Angeles' Red Line (I'm not sorry)">}}

The fear that TOD is ultimately displacing people who _need_ transit to make room for people who _like_ transit is a growing concern. [A widely-circulated LA times story from early 2018](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rosenthal-transit-gentrification-metro-ridership-20180220-story.html) even linked developments along LA's Purple and Expo lines, and correlated increases in adjacent real estate, to falling ridership on Metro. The people who can actually afford to live near the train are, paradoxically, the ones least likely to make full use of it. In transit industry jargon, these are "choice riders" -- ones who consider transit an amenity in the same vein as a nearby Equinox club. They'll use it when it's convenient, but certainly don't depend on it, and will probably opt for Uber or Lyft before transferring to a bus.

Transit isn't built _for_ any demographic in particular. At the same time, deploying transit in a way that is predictably going to drive people out of their homes seems to more than defeat its purpose. We want everyone to want to use transit, but we should also recognize that the marginal utility of living near a rapid transit station for someone who is going to use it every day is greater than for someone who views it as an amenity that will help them beat traffic twice a year on their way to the Big Game. Without understanding and managing the interaction between transit and displacement, we run the risk of replicating in our cities the problems that plague transit in the suburbs: low ridership causing funding cuts causing low ridership in a death spiral that limits everyone’s mobility, but disproportionately so the working class.

## A different story at a different scale

This story of gentrification has birthed a thousand SF open-mic jokes and has Guess Who board of classic characters: the yuppie artists, garage coffee shop proprietors, luxury housing developers, and corrupt aldermen whose machinations turn a neighborhood with a century of history into a souless nowhere. But as a lense for understanding why cities like San Francisco, Boston, Seattle, and New York are so expensive, it puts the cart before the horse (or, uh, the pedicab before the white guy with dreads).

These cities are adding jobs much faster than they're building housing -- [in San Francisco it's something like seven new jobs for every one new unit of housing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-23/why-can-t-they-build-more-homes-where-the-jobs-are). Simply put, there isn't a home in the city for everyone who wants to work there. Not even close. So the radius of what constitutes an acceptable commute expands, far outside the city and even past the reaches of the lengthy, if sparse, BART lines that extend through the East Bay. People working minimum-wage jobs in San Francisco (you know, where the jobs actually are) are spending [three hours one-way](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/business/economy/san-francisco-commute.html) just to get to their jobs via transit.


### And the winner is...?
Neither of these stories is the _wrong_ one to tell about transit-oriented development, but you'll find that they describe two very different dimensions of affordability and make compelling arguments by focusing on the effects within a larger or smaller radius. At a local level, tenant protections like rent control and right-to-counsel can make an enormous difference in ensuring that the current residents of a neighborhood can continue to live there as the city changes around them. Knowing that housing prices are projected to dip in a decade or so is very cold comfort to someone who is being priced out of their own neighborhood this year because a light rail line is opening. But at the same time, _cities change and grow_, and wishing that time would pass your city by is both fruitless and a terrible curse in its own right. At a regional level, desirability is driven by things that have nothing to do with the amenities in any given neighborhood: the economy, climate, and politics of the region; in the Bay Area, the single most desirable amenity a neighborhood can offer is a gateway to a reasonable commute; this is what ultimately drives up rent near sparse BART and Caltrain stations, especially when the adjacent neighborhood is shockingly under-built.

## Getting TOD very, very wrong
So which story 

So when we consider the effect that transit-oriented development is going to have

What do we actually know about how transit access impacts displacement?
My takeaway from this is that there is no generalizable solution to building TOD in a way that meets the needs of its host neighborhood. Instead of thinking about TOD as a  “one-shot” project to build a neighborhood from scratch, our housing policy should permit density near all kinds of transit lines, not just rail. This will encourage

The story about displacement is very different in areas where existing properties are primarily occupied by homeowners versus renters, etc.

Once we start thinking about housing beyond the scope of a neighborhood, we move beyond the scale of walkability and we need to assess how people are going to get from one place to another [less bad transition here please]

The size and sprawl of American cities also makes them very difficult to blanket with effective transit service. Except in places where it’s laughably bad, there is no American city with anything resembling equitable access to quality transit.

The “missing middle” in transit
Trying to prevent displacement while building more equitable cities in America is like being caught between a rock and a hard place. Let’s recap why: transit is a useful amenity which, like roads, is built as a public good. The process by which it is built is nominally informed by equity concerns, but (when done effectively) with the intended outcome of maximizing access on its own, rather than closing the access gap between captive riders and choice riders. But unlike roads, rapid transit access in American cities is far from ubiquitous. To the housing market, it becomes an amenity, like a grocery store across the street or some kind of twee kickboxing gym, used to justify rent increases which push captive riders farther from quality transit.

The paradoxical result is that access compounds among choice riders (who are happy to live near a train, but certainly do not depend on it) while it is denied to captive riders, who would both make more extensive use of it, and benefit more from its presence. We might assume that for some displaced captive riders, the train is still a net benefit to them — they may find an apartment just a few minutes’ walk from where they used to live, but make that time up with higher-quality transit whisking them through the remainder of their commute. 

The Purple Line/Wiltshire example shows us one model that may not work, in the sense that it neither drives ridership nor produces equitable outcomes. When new transit lines are built, the areas immediately adjacent to stations are often aggressively upzoned, in an attempt to maximize the number of people who can walk to the station. This kind of transit-oriented development may be drastically denser than the surrounding neighborhood, and usually requires a zoning exception. The result of this kind of development pattern is visible to anyone who lives near rapid transit built in the last ten years or so — tall, shiny apartment complexes with some upscale […]

What else can we do?
- Talking point from YIMBY: maximize number, not percentage of new affordable units
- SB827: rent freezes near new TOD on 5-10 year timescale
- 

Ultimately, our goal — my goal — is for rapid transit access to resemble a cheap, ubiquitous public good.
