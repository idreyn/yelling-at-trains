Folks, things are bad. To be more specific, America's cities face a crisis of affordability, congestion, and emissions, and their rapid transit systems are far from up to the task. Yet attempts to expand them -- New York's Second Avenue Subway and San Francisco's Central Subway, to name a few -- have suffered from years of delays and billions of dollars in cost overruns. There are some well-understood reasons why things start pricey and get pricier here: we pay high wages (rightfully so, for dangerous work) but overstaff construction sites. We suffer from a nasty case of "Not Invented Here" syndrome that prevents us from importing modern design practices from around the world. We have many layers of governance, and sprawling metropolitan areas, that force planners to interact with many municipalities and counties on top of city and state governments. Thinkpiecery about the state of American transit construction [accurately explains these factors](https://ggwash.org/view/40377/if-we-lowered-transit-construction-costs-we-could-build-more-transit), and laments that we rarely build new transit because it's so expensive. But it often omits the other half of a vicious feedback loop: _transit is so expensive because we rarely build it_.

 In many cities rapid transit expansions have nearly become a once-in-a-generation affair: each one is a tangle of uncertainty for transit agencies unaccustomed to planning and overseeing construction projects -- and a meal ticket for contractors preying on their hapless counterparts in the public sector. High costs and slipping timelines are not just devastating to the projects that they affect; they kneecap regional ambitions, normalize our low expectations, and most importantly, push back the planning of other projects by years or decades. This ensures that transit agencies pay the same startup cost over and over, and convince themslves that miscommunication, graft, and overdesign are fundamental to transit expansion.

Instead of repeating these mistakes, old American cities like Boston and San Francisco should commit now to "buying transit in bulk" -- breathtaking, decades-long expansion plans that allow transit agencies to accumulate in-house planning expertise and leverage economies of scale. The Washington Metro and the Bay Area's BART are both indispensable to the regions they serve, and were largely bought in bulk back in the 1960s. China has gone to Costco to buy a whole pallet of transit for dozens of its cities, though has paid for it in less than commendable ways. Today, Los Angeles might provide a model to follow. It's funding and building transit at a remarkable pace, and while it's not doing everything right, Boston could learn a lot by watching.

## In Which Construction In Boston Goes Over Budget

So I don't want to be the one to jinx it, but the MBTA -- "the T" to its college drinking buddies -- appears to really be building the Green Line Extension (GLX) to Somerville, finally fulfilling [a prophecy inscribed on a mysterious ivory dagger](http://www.wbur.org/radioboston/2016/05/09/green-line-history) excavated during the Big Dig. This is the agency's first urban rail expansion since the _mid 1980s_ when the Red Line was extended as far northwest as standard-issue Catholic racism would permit, and it's particularly exciting because it came very close to not happening at all. In 2015, the MBTA announced that the budget for the project was spiraling out of control. Originally projected to cost $900 million, then $1.2 billion, then $2.2 billion (2015 dollars), the agency projected an increase of another billion dollars, bringing the project above $3 billion. While the budget's line items certainly added up to the newly quoted figure, taken as a whole the project had exited even the exosphere of cost control. In late 2015, the agency put cancelled the remaining contracts and put the project on hold.

For the MBTA, the Green Line Extension's brush with cancellation was a moment of reckoning. GLX was supposed to benefit from a project managment technique called "design-build", where the same contractor who draws up blueprints (so to speak) for the extension is also responsible for building it, incentivizing forethought and tight internal communcation. This seems so sensible that it almost seems silly to give it a name, but it's a different world than the "design-bid-build" one that the MBTA is used to operating in, in which one contractor draws up plans for the project and the T uses those plans to solicit bids from other contractors to construct it. In the absence of that intermediary "bid" step as a means of cutting costs, the agency became deeply overreliant on WSK to assess the true cost of the project. When the T hired a consultant to help them assess how the project had gone wrong, they were told that they didn't have nearly enough expertise on staff to implement design-build correctly, and was relying too heavily on external consulants to perform critically budget-sensitive pieces of work. _They hired a consultant to tell them that they were hiring too many consultants_, successfully making themselves the butt of a suffocating office holiday party joke.

The MBTA needed about 40 or 50 fully-time staff to effectively manage the project, a far cry from the dozen or so employees who were managing it part-time. No one there understood the cause of the cost increases well enough to negotiate them back down, so what remained was to give up and try again, cancelling their contracts with WSK and leaving hundreds of millions in sunk cost on the table. Two years later, in 2017, the agency scaled back some of their more ambitious plans, and a new rolling ball of firms styling themselves GLX Contractors picked up the mantle, promising to deliver the project for a billion less than the figure that WSK had quoted and putting the project back on track for completion (this time for serious, you guys) in 2021.

While the tale of the Green Line Extension has a happy ending, its epilogue is bittersweet. Imagine: in 2021 the line opens, and there's confetti and a ribbon-cutting ceremony with cute transit-themed cupcakes. Someone updates their Green Line Bar Crawl map, and Reddit gets into a fight over whether Aeronaut Brewing is overrated hipster garbage. And over at the MBTA, an absolutely massive undertaking winds down and shuts off the lights. People who have spent the last five years learning how to effectively wield design-build to deliver a light rail line -- how to streamline writing legal boilerplate, how to draw up exacting specifications for elevator functionality, who to call when digging crews hit an unexpected utility line -- will go home and move on with their lives. When the MBTA next gets the wherewithal to build more rail (and it has no concrete plans to do so through 2040) all of the relationships and expertise built up on the job during GLX will have to be rebuilt from scratch, at the cost of many thousands of person-hours and millions of dollars.

## Learning by doing

In retrospect, perhaps it shouldn't be surprising that a transit agency with no recent experience in building light rail [^bigdig] would struggle with its first attempt in recent memory. As we've seen, the T doesn't design or build extensions itself -- the construction work is left to a rotating cast of construction megafirms, which in turn oversee an _Yggdrasil_ of subcontractors and sub-subcontractors. But it also has limited input into when and when new rail lines will be built. In the Boston area, this kind of decision making is done in fits and starts by a large group of public agencies, like the Massachusetts Department of Transportation and the city of Somerville, taking into account public input, budgets, state and municipal priorities (and in the case of GLX, lawsuits). Between someone saying "there should be a train here"[^dennys] and the first day of service many years later, dozens of government entities, hundreds of firms, and thousands of workers will have a hand in bringing the dream to life.

This not to suggest that the MBTA is just a conduit through which public money generated upstream is funneled into construction work downsteam. The T's role in making GLX happen is limited, but it's central -- it makes few decisions on its own, but is a collaborator in just about all of them, giving it a chance to see opportunities and dangers that most collaborators in the project won't anticipate on their own. The MBTA that oversaw the last few years of GLX didn't know how to use this position to its full advantage; with its inadequate staffing and shot-in-the-dark approach to contracting, it was barely able to fulfill its own role, leaving too much of the job of cost control in the hands of contractors. But imagine that even before GLX was complete, the MBTA was already planning another rail extension, and then another, and another. This kind of long-term thinking would justify a larger capital construction team that would be able to learn from their own past mistakes, look for cost-saving opportunities _across_ projects, and even begin to take more planning and design into their own hands. This version of the MBTA, better at capturing successes and failures in institutional memory, would be able to bring both its bird's eye view and the benefit of hindsight to bear in a few important ways:

- **Reducing costs by designing once:** every transit project has its quirks and foibles that need special design attention, but choices like station decor, signalling components, and electrical substations probably only need to be made once. By retaining knowledge about which designs, components, and materials work well and which ones don't, the MBTA can gradually develop a set of standards to hand to contractors. This reduces the size of decisions that need to be made, and in turn the number of billable hours, reams of Request For Procurement paperwork, expensive over-designs, and "good tries" that contractors produce.

- **Building lasting relationships in the public and private sector:** as we've seen, building something like GLX requires establishing a lot of formal relationships between organizations, which on the ground really means that two people have to get cozy sending email back and forth to each other. Between two public agencies, this is as likely to prevent _Parks and Rec_-style infighting as anything else, but I'd argue that the real benefit here is the leverage it provides when dealing with private-sector contractors. Knowing that the MBTA has a decade or two of light rail projects in the pipeline might suppress megacontracting firms' [instincts to overcharge and underdeliver](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2015/12/14/what-went-wrong-with-bostons-green-line-extension/comment-page-1/), knowing it could cost them a return trip to the buffet of local transit projects in a few years' time.[^new-cars]

## No half measures

Surviving the 21st century is going to require making it affordable for working people to inhabit our cities, decoupling the throughput of our economies from the throughput of our freeways, and radicially curbing our carbon emissions. This is gonna be kinda tough, and American cities (I'll continue to pick on Boston in particular here) need to get serious about the fact that timid, piecemeal expansion projects will not make much of a difference on any of these fronts.

Perhaps surprisingly, today's Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Agency -- "METRO" to its spin class buddies -- provides the model we'd do best to follow! It's opened more than 100 miles of new rapid transit since 1990 in an uphill battle against a transit-skeptical, car-oriented culture. Boston's dense, walkable neighborhoods and suburbs will benefit even more 

Maybe we could establish a national public design agency, something like a nationalized Skanska or Fluor[^nationalize] to help local transit agencies plan extensions more effectively with incentives fully aligned -- after all, for many of these projects, the federal government foots a significant portion of the bill. Or, cities could take matters into their own hands.

Ostensibly, the reason the MBTA has no concrete expansion plans after GLX is because it has no money. In fact, the converse is true; if the agency had an ambition to see itself as the curator of systemwide improvements rather than piecemeal line extensions, there would be ample sources of revenue available. Los Angeles has shown us that this is the case; its Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Agency -- "METRO" to its spin class buddies -- has opened more than 100 miles of new rapid transit since 1990 in an uphill battle against a transit-skeptical, car-oriented culture. It's done so by committing to a visionary, long-range plan, which it uses to justify keeping strong in-house planning capabilities to develop a years-long backlog of projects, waiting for federal funding to become available. And in 2016, it passed its historic Measure M by a 67-33 at the ballot, raising more than $120 billion by inspiring voters to help fund its vision over the next half-century. The Boston area is much smaller, and its dense neighborhoods will respond much more effectively to improved transit -- it would need only a fraction of that budget to weave an equivalently powerful narrative.

Imagine this: Boston commits to building a large amount of transit up front. First we draw a nice map of planned projects -- [there are so many permutations on the internet that we might just be able to reuse one](https://www.google.com/search?q=mbta+fantasy+map&tbm=isch). Then we identify a series of funding schemes -- perhaps a regional sales, followed by a phased-in decongestion tax as viable transit alternatives appear to automobile commutes, and aggressive value capture near stations. Finally, we use the brand-new [regional ballot mechanism approved by the Massachusett State Senate in 2018](https://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/07/senate_approves_regional_ballo.html) to directly ask voters whether they want to pay for more transit.

[^glx-new-starts]: The Green Line extension is the only project to receive funding under the New Starts grant...is this true? A. said it is

[^dennys]: It's fine when other people do it, but when I try this people tell me things like "you're blocking traffic" and "lower your voice, sir, Denny's is a family establishment".

[^bigdig]: This is almost entirely true, but the MBTA did participate in [a re-routing of the Green Line near North Station during the Big Dig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causeway_Street_Elevated), eliminating a viaduct in favor of a new tunnel. 

[^new-cars]: For all my incessant, boozed-up complaining about the MBTA over Thanksgiving, the agency has a solid set of crucial capital investments in the works as we speak. Arguably the most important of these is procurement of new Red and Orange Line cars to replace the current fleet that is far past its projected service lifespan. Ordering the Red and Orange fleets simultaneously from CSR Sifang is a baby step towards leveraging economies of scale, since the design of the cars is mostly the same. As they inevitably break down, catch fire, and get surfed on in the coming decades, having a common set of parts and a larger pool of mechanics to fix them will help the agency do more cost-effective maintenance.

[^nationalize]: Or we could, you know, nationalize Fluor.

[^hopefully-sooner]: Though hopefully sooner. [The Measure M project listing](http://theplan.metro.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/measurem_ordinance_16-01.pdf) is almost comically long-range -- is LA really going to want a "Historic Downtown Streetcar" in 2057? -- but the agency is already accelerating some of its more conservative timelines, especially as part of [a push to present a respectable set of transit offerings to the world by the 2028 Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-eight_by_%2728).
