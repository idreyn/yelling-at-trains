I don't want to be the one to jinx it, but the MBTA -- "the T" to its college drinking buddies -- appears to really be building the Green Line Extension (GLX) to Somerville, finally fulfilling [a prophecy inscribed on a mysterious ivory dagger](http://www.wbur.org/radioboston/2016/05/09/green-line-history) excavated during the Big Dig. This is the agency's first urban rail expansion since the _mid 1980s_ when the Red Line was extended as far northwest as Catholic racism would permit, and it's particularly exciting because it came very close to not happening at all. In 2015, the MBTA announced that the budget for the project was spiraling out of control. Originally projected to cost $900 million, then $1.2 billion, then $2.2 billion (2015 dollars), the agency projected an increase of another billion dollars, bringing the project above $3 billion. While the budget's line items certainly added up to the newly quoted figure, taken as a whole the project had exited even the exosphere of cost control. In late 2015, the agency put cancelled the remaining contracts and put the project on hold.

The cost overruns plaguing GLX are far from an isolated incident -- with per-rider price tags sometimes coming in an order of magnitude higher than in Asia or Europe, understanding and managing construction costs is the white whale of American  transit planning. There are some well-understood reasons why things are so pricey here: we pay high wages (rightfully so, for dangerous work) but overstaff construction sites. We prioritize minimizing street-level disruption. We suffer from a nasty case of "Not Invented Here" syndrome that prevents us from importing modern design practices from around the world. We have many layers of governance, and sprawling metropolitan areas, that force planners to interact with many municipalities and counties on top of city and state governments. A Greater Greater Washington article by John Ricco called _[If we lowered construction costs, we could build more transit](https://ggwash.org/view/40377/if-we-lowered-transit-construction-costs-we-could-build-more-transit)_ does a good job at succinctly summarizing these factors, and rightfully points out that addressing them is prerequisite to ever building significant amounts of new subway in our country.

Ricco describes one half of a virtuous cycle. The other half of which is: _if we built more transit, we could lower construction costs_. New subway construction in America, like New York's Second Avenue Subway or San Francisco's Central Subway, is rare enough that it's practically a once-in-a-generation affair in many cities. Because of this, every team that carries it out -- really, a complicated web of public agencies and private contractors -- is learning on the job, making mistakes and growing expertise at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. In other words, we pay the startup cost of learning to build transit every time we attempt to do so.

I'd like to lay some thoughts here on how "buying transit in bulk" would improve the dismal state of transit construction here in the States. I recognize that it's one thing to identify the problem; it's quite another to build the political will and funding mechanism to actually kickstart a significant amount of capital investment. As we'll see, though, cities in our backyard like Seattle and Los Angeles are perhaps inadvertently putting this theory to the test, and my hope is that watching them combat the vicious cycle of mismanagement and cost overrun that currently plagues other cities will provide another argument in favor of large-scale, continuous investment in building transit, rather than the timid, piecemeal expansions we see today.

## In Which Construction In Boston Goes Over Budget

For the MBTA, the Green Line Extension's brush with cancellation was a moment of reckoning. GLX was supposed to benefit from a project managment technique called "design-build", where the same contractor who draws up blueprints (so to speak) for the extension is also responsible for building it, incentivizing forethought and tight internal communcation. This seems so sensible that it almost seems silly to give it a name, but it's a different world than the "design-bid-build" one that the MBTA is used to operating in, in which one contractor draws up plans for the project and the T uses those plans to solicit bids from other contractors to construct it. In the absence of that intermediary "bid" step as a means of cutting costs, the agency to become deeply overreliant on WSK to assess the true cost of the project. When the T hired a consultant to help them assess how the project had gone wrong, they were told that they didn't have nearly enough expertise on staff to implement design-build correctly, and was relying too heavily on external consulants to perform critically budget-sensitive pieces of work. _They hired a consultant to tell them that they were hiring too many consultants_, successfully making themselves the butt of a suffocating office holiday party joke.

The MBTA needed about 40 or 50 fully-time staff to effectively manage the project, a far cry from the dozen or so employees who were managing it part-time. No one there understood the cause of the cost increases well enough to negotiate them back down, so what remained was to give up and try again, cancelling their contracts with WSK and leaving hundreds of millions in sunk cost on the table. Two years later, in 2017, the agency scaled back some of their more ambitious plans, and a new rolling ball of firms styling themselves GLX Contractors picked up the mantle, promising to deliver the project for a billion less than the figure that WSK had quoted and putting the project back on track for completion (this time for serious, you guys) in 2021.

While the tale of the Green Line Extension has a happy ending, its epilogue is bittersweet. Imagine: in 2021 the line opens, and there's confetti and a ribbon-cutting ceremony with cute transit-themed cupcakes. Someone updates their Green Line Bar Crawl map, and Reddit gets into a fight over whether Aeronaut Brewing is overrated hipster garbage. And over at the MBTA, an absolutely massive undertaking winds down and shuts off the lights. People who have spent the last five years learning how to effectively wield design-build to deliver a light rail line -- how to streamline writing legal boilerplate, how to draw up exacting specifications for elevator functionality, who to call when digging crews hit an unexpected utility line -- will go home and move on with their lives. When the MBTA next gets the wherewithal to build more rail (and it has no concrete plans to do so through 2040) all of the relationships and expertise built up on the job during GLX will have to be rebuilt from scratch, at the cost of many thousands of person-hours and millions of dollars.

## Learning by doing

In retrospect, perhaps it shouldn't be surprising that a transit agency with no recent experience in building light rail [^bigdig] would struggle with its first attempt in recent memory. As we've seen, the T doesn't design or build extensions itself -- the construction work is left to a rotating cast of construction megafirms, which in turn oversee an _Yggdrasil_ of subcontractors and sub-subcontractors. But it also has limited input into when and when new rail lines will be built. In the Boston area, this kind of decision making is done in fits and starts by a large group of public agencies, like the Massachusetts Department of Transportation and the city of Somerville, taking into account public input, budgets, state and municipal priorities (and in the case of GLX, lawsuits). Between someone saying "there should be a train here"[^dennys] and the first day of service many years later, dozens of government entities, hundreds of firms, and thousands of workers will have a hand in bringing the dream to life.

This not to suggest that the MBTA is just a conduit through which public money generated upstream is funneled into construction work downsteam. The T's role in making GLX happen is limited, but it's central -- it makes few decisions on its own, but is a collaborator in just about all of them, giving it a chance to see opportunities and dangers that most collaborators in the project won't anticipate on their own. The MBTA that oversaw the last few years of GLX didn't know how to use this position to its full advantage; with its inadequate staffing and shot-in-the-dark approach to contracting, it was barely able to fulfill its own role, leaving too much of the job of cost control in the hands of contractors. But imagine that even before GLX was complete, the MBTA was already planning another rail extension, and then another, and another. This kind of long-term thinking would justify a larger capital construction team that would be able to learn from their _own_ past mistakes, look for cost-saving opportunities _across_ projects, and even begin to take more planning and design into their own hands. This version of the MBTA, better at capturing successes and failures in institutional memory, would be able to bring both its bird's eye view and the benefit of hindsight to bear in a few important ways:

- **Reducing costs by designing once:** every transit project has its quirks and foibles that need special design attention, but choices like station decor, signalling components, and electrical substations probably only need to be made once. By retaining knowledge about which designs, components, and materials work well and which ones don't, the MBTA can gradually develop a set of standards to hand to contractors. This reduces the size of decisions that need to be made, and in turn the number of billable hours, reams of Request For Procurement paperwork, expensive over-designs, and "good tries" that contractors produce.

- **Building lasting relationships in the public and private sector:** as we've seen, building something like GLX requires establishing a lot of formal relationships between organizations, which on the ground really means that two people have to get cozy sending email back and forth to each other. Between two public agencies, this is as likely to prevent _Parks and Rec_-style infighting as anything else, but I'd argue that the real benefit here is the leverage it provides when dealing with private-sector contractors. Knowing that the MBTA has a decade or two of light rail projects in the pipeline might suppress megacontracting firms' [instincts to overcharge and underdeliver](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2015/12/14/what-went-wrong-with-bostons-green-line-extension/comment-page-1/), knowing it could cost them a return trip to the buffet of local transit projects in a few years' time.

For all my incessant, boozed-up complaining about the MBTA over Thanksgiving, the agency has a solid set of crucial capital investments in the works as we speak. Arguably the most important of these is procurement of new Red and Orange Line cars to replace the current fleet that is far past its projected service lifespan. Ordering the Red and Orange fleets simultaneously from CSR Sifang is a baby step towards leveraging economies of scale, since the design of the cars is mostly the same. As they inevitably break down, catch fire, and get surfed on in the coming decades, having a common set of parts and a larger pool of mechanics to fix them will help the agency do more cost-effective maintenance.

## No half measures

[^dennys]: Sure, it's fine when other people do it, but when I try people tell me things like "you're blocking traffic" and "lower your voice, sir, Denny's is a family establishment"

[^bigdig]: This is almost entirely true, but the MBTA did participate in [a re-routing of the Green Line near North Station during the Big Dig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causeway_Street_Elevated), eliminating a viaduct in favor of a new tunnel.
