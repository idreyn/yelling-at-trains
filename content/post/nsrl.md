Imagine for a moment that your city lacked a highway network entirely. Instead, it had a series of ordinary two-lane streets in place of Interstates X, Y, and Z, each with massively wide turns and hundreds of feet of totally undeveloped grassland on each side -- in short, everything that a highway implies except the pavement. The roads don't connect downtown, but, lo, there is an _pre-excavated_ tunnel under the city center that we can connect the roadways. There would be no debate about whether to build highways on this land. It would have unanimous political support. You and I would be be driving backhoes around right now racing to get this project done last week.

I'd like to suggest that Boston's existing MBTA Commuter Rail is quite like these massively underused interstates-to-be. Its 398 miles already cover massive distances and connect Boston to many of its outlying communities. Just like our hypothetical roadways, the Commuter Rail is split into two entirely disconnected halves terminating about 1.5 miles apart -- a northern system that branches outward from North Station, and a southern system that branches out from, you guessed it, South Station. Adding capacity to a railway doesn't much resemble expanding a highway -- rather than adding parallel tracks, it mean buying better vehicles, improving stations, and running more trains. But luckily, there is nothing metaphorical about the pre-excavated tunnel under the city. During the Big Dig, we cleared a path between North and South Station of all kinds of utilities and archaelogical surprises, and filled it with loose earth, waiting for Boston to regain its appetite for tunneling and build the North-South Rail Link.

Just from a glance at our subway map, the benefit of the North-South Rail Link (NSRL) is evident. Getting from North to South Station requires two, count 'em, two subway transfers, making commuting into and then out of Boston on the Commuter Rail the kind of journey Tolkien wrote about. You can imagine that almost nobody does this, and that this service gap contributes to greater Boston's north-south cultural divide. But the rationale for building the Link goes way beyond enabling a certain commuting pattern -- it's about building a better kind of rail service on the strong skeleton the Commuter Rail provides. To really understand why Boston should build the NSRL, and why a small but growing number of activists and politicians are extremely excited about it, we need to spark a cig, throw on a turtleneck, and follow me to the transit Mecca that is Berlin, Germany.

## An old, new kind of rail service
You won't spend more than a few days in Berlin before spotting this practical, unfussy map of its rail network:

_God damn_, you say loudly, outing yourself immediately as an American tourist. _That's a big subway system!_ It turns out you're about half right. While the subway (U-Bahn) is fairly expansive, most of the lines on this map are a different network altogether called the S-Bahn. This network extends farther outside of the city and stops less often than the subway. But beyond that, it's pretty similar -- it runs electrified trains, uses tunnels downtown, works with the same fare system, and, especially on the central "trunk" where many lines converge, has frequencies that rival the U-Bahn. The experience of catching an S-Bahn train isn't fundamentally different than riding the subway, which is reflected in this map that makes them hard to tell apart. This blurring of lines between rapid transit and regional rail is crucial to enabling the walkable communities Europe is known for to exist even far from the city center.

_Pshaw_, you reply, _That May Work In Those Countries, But It Would Never Fly Over Hereâ„¢_. Yet Greater Boston has all of the ingredients required to support a Berlin-style regional network. Many outlying towns in the area predate archetypical car-oriented American suburbs by centuries, and have a walkable and mixed-use core ideal for increased transit frequency. Places like Waltham and Salem already have vibrant downtown areas and are building high-density, transit-oriented housing near the commuter rail even in the absence of any major improvements to the system. Introducing respectable train frequencies into these systems would kick off a virtuous cycle of more walkable development, more housing, and more commuting options for everyone, all of which would make my stupid lefty heart swell with pride, but more importantly would massively expand the list of places with frequent transit service to Boston.

For other communities adjacent to the Commuter Rail system, an upgrade is _long_ overdue. The Fairmont Line runs through dense and transit-dependent areas of Boston that would massively benefit from more frequent service. The Newburyport/Rockport runs through Chelsea and Lynn, which have struggled in the past half-century and where recent immigrants and longtime residents alike struggle to efficiently commute to their jobs in Boston. The new Boston Landing stop and coming West Station on the Framingham/Worcester line, if served frequently enough, would bring rapid transit to areas of Allston served either slowly or not at all by the Green Line. In a growing city, the alternative to this solution is not "do nothing" -- if we don't upgrade the Commuter Rail, we'll need to find other, more expensive solutions to serve these areas properly.

## Capacity for the 21st century
Even understanding the benefits that S-Bahn style service would provide to Greater Boston, but it's fair to ask why we need the NSRL to enable this -- can't we just run trains more frequently on existing tracks?

It turns out that while we could run more trains than we do today, our current infrastructure makes it impossible to scale up to true Euro-style regional rail. There are many reasons why Commuter Rail trains run infrequently, in particular the cost of staffing, but the biggest problem is that you can only fit so many trains into North or South Station (what we'd call a "stub-end terminal") at a time. Movement into and out of a stub-end platform must be made slowly [^1], and in practice about 30% of train movement in these stations is made by trains entering or exiting service, not carrying passengers. Moving trains past each other in a complex railyard is an undertaking not unlike a DJing a Catholic high school dance -- as much as you want to keep things moving, the speed is capped so the participants don't get too close to each other.

This is why the MBTA is currently planning the South Station Expansion (SSX) project to add seven new tracks to South Station at the cost of about $2 billion. This project would increase the capacity of (half of) the Commuter Rail system, but we'll quickly run up against its limits in a decade or two, this time with nowhere to expand to. _The_ major benefit of the Link is that connecting North and South stations removes the stub-end bottleneck, allowing commuter trains to pass through the core of the system just like the subway already does. In fact, this new service pattern would effectively create a new subway line for downtown Boston, allowing riders to travel between North Station, South Station, and Back Bay with unprecedented ease and relieving stress from overcrowded downtown transfer stations. What's more, a [1995 study](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/561e6ed5e4b039248a6a94aa/t/5646a941e4b0a4a3eef11385/1447471425380/NSRL+Tech+Report+No.5-Operations+Study.pdf) suggested that building the NSRL could save the MBTA about $140 million (2017 dollars) in annual operating costs [^2], in particular because they will no longer have to drag trainsets loudly past my old house at 3 in the morning on the lone Cambridge freight track that connects the two halves of the system.

There are some secondary capacity improvements that the a well-planned NSRL would enable as well. Like your toothbrush, any trains that run through the Link would have to run on electric power rather than diesel, which would mean they could accelerate faster and reach their destinations more quickly than the existing locomotives. Retrofitting platforms to permit level boarding on these new trains (aligning platform and train heights to eliminate flip-out boarding staircases) would reduce time spent at stations. Electric trains don't have a locomotive pushing or pulling the trainset -- instead, each car has its own onboard propulsion drawing from an overheard wire or third rail -- which means it's much easier to configure smaller sets of cars together for off-peak service, [as will be possible with the new vehicles coming to Caltrain](http://caltrain-hsr.blogspot.com/2017/06/frequent-trains-off-peak.html) that will carry thousands of passengers and their loud conversations about their startup's top-secret IP up and down Silicon Valley.

## Organization, electronics, _and_ concrete

Knowing what we know about the Germans, you probably won't be surprised to learn that they have an pithy and pragmatic expression encapsulating their philosophy behind running trains. _Organisation vor Elektronik vor Beton_, meaing "Organization before Electronics before Concrete", is a maxim that serves as a kind of checklist for transit planners deciding what kinds of investments to make:

1. First, improve your _organization_: schedules, routes, and policies, to be as efficient as they possibly can be.

2. Then, ugrade your _electronics_: fare collection, power, train control, signaling, and communication systems to get the most bang for your buck from the existing track-miles of service.

3. Once you've maxed out these other strategies, and only then, should you spend money on _concrete_: new tracks, bridges, tunnels, etc.

Unsurprisingly, these are listed in increasing order of cost -- improving organization will often [net a transit agency some savings](http://amateurplanner.blogspot.com/2016/09/a-single-letter-costs-t-23-million.html), while pouring concrete is a multibillion dollar affair these days[^3].

That's why the NSRL must be viewed as a _platform_ for better organization and electronics, not just an expensive piece of concrete.

So even as in advocating for many tons of concrete to be poured beneath Boston, we should consider the role that organization and electronics must play in a successful reimagining of the Commuter Rail system, possibly even before we break ground on the crucial NSRL tunnel. For instance, the current fare collection system, whereby a conductor checks everyone's ticket (or tries to) needs to be replaced by pay-on-platform with random inspections. At a system level, we should make sure
