_You don't have much time and this is important, so here's the pitch: we can massively expand the reach of Boston's transit system, enabling whole new commuting patterns and turning the region's housing problem on its head, by connecting the two "halves" of the commuter rail system and modernizing the network. This can be done cost-effectively. If you live in the Boston area, you should call your representative and tell them that you want this to happen._

Imagine if your city lacked a highway network entirely, but had a series of two-lane streets in place of Interstates X, Y, and Z, each with massively wide turns and hundreds of feet of totally undeveloped grassland on each side -- in short, everything that a highway implies except the pavement. The roads don't connect through downtown, but, lo, there is an _pre-excavated_ tunnel through the city center that we just need to connect the roadways. There would be no debate about whether to build highways on this land. It would have unanimous political support. You and I would be be driving backhoes around right now racing to get this project done last week.

In this post I will argue that Boston's existing MBTA Commuter Rail system is in many respects quite like these massively underused interstates-to-be. It covers massive distances with a manageable number of interactions with roadways ("grade crossings") and connects Boston to most of its outlying communities. But where we would add more lanes to a highway to improve its capacity, we improve the capacity of the railway not with more parallel tracks but with better trains and stations, and by investing in higher-frequency service.
Just like our hypothetical Boston's commuter rail system consists of two entirely disconnected halves -- a northern system that branches outward from North Station, and a southern system that branches out from, you know, South Station. Traveling between these stations requires riding two subway lines, which makes this kind of commute the kind of journey that Tolkien wrote about -- you can imagine that almost no one attempts to cross the region on commuter rail. But besides the obvious problem of moving from north to south, the gap also causes many less obvious problems that prevent the region from using its impressive number of track-miles to anywhere near their full potential.

A project known as the North-South Rail Link (which its friends know as the NSRL or fondly, "the Link") would close this gap with a roughly 1.5 mile tunnel running below downtown to connect our two Commuter Rail terminals. Obviously, when making any mention of new tunnels in downtown Boston we must first acknowledge that we're raising the spectre of the protracted Big Dig, but this time we get some major loot

We've been talking about this possibility for a long time, and we even cleared the space between North and South Station of any obstacles during the Big Dig, meaning that it would be unusually straightforward to dig the tunnel itself -- the bulk of the spending would be on portals connecting to the surface and infrastructure to support modern service patterns on the network.

The state is currently conducting a [feasibility study](http://www.rtands.com/index.php/track-maintenance/off-track-maintenance/massdot-selects-arup-to-lead-nsrl-feasibility-study.html) to determine whether the NSRL is a good use of our money. Some wicked smaht people at Harvard [have recently pegged the cost at about $6 billion](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/08/downtown-boston-rail-link-could-be-built-more-cheaply-study-says/) for a project that would shorten commute times for about [130,000 people](http://old.mbta.com/uploadedfiles/About_the_T/Board_Meetings/StateofCommuterRailSystem.pdf) and bring [another 96,000](https://moulton.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/NEC-Slide-Deck-.pdf) into the system. As I'll explain, we're on the hook for a few billion dollars worth of upgrades to the Commuter Rail system regardless, but among the alternatives NSRL is by far the most effective use of our money. What I hope to do (and you can too!) is explain the benefits of the project in a way that makes people excited about its potentially transformative effects. I really believe that no other transit project in the United States has the potential to do as much for the region it serves as the North-South Rail Link.

## A transformation waiting to happen
Calling Boston's regional rail network "Commuter Rail" isn't inaccurate, but it's not particularly ambitious. While most rides on the system are between work and home, some riders do use the service to make recreational trips (notably for sporting events) suggesting latent demand for more metro-like service. This is hardly an Ol' Musky-level revolution in transporation thought -- other countries that operate suburban rail service do so without such a heavy focus on commuters. They run trains frequently, even outside of peak commuting hours, creating a network that supports all kinds of trips, whether to work, the grocery store, or out to the clubs on the weekend. Donning a turtleneck and sparking a cigarette, transit advocates commonly make comparisons to specific European incarnations of this concept such as the _S-Bahn_ in German cities and the _RER_ in France.

_"Pshaw"_, you say, _"That May Work In Those Countries, But It Would Never Fly Over Hereâ„¢"_. Yet unlike zany ideas like universal healthcare and nationalized telecom providers, which would never work in the US because, hey, what's that over there! -- Greater Boston has all of the ingredients required to support a regional network that goes far beyond "commuter rail". 

As in Europe, many outlying towns in the Boston area predate archetypical car-oriented American suburbs by centuries, and have a walkable and mixed-use core ideal for increased transit frequency. Towns like Waltham and Salem already have vibrant downtown areas and are building high-density, transit-oriented housing near the commuter rail even in the absence of any major improvements to the system. Introducing respectable transit into these systems would kick off a virtuous cycle of more walkable development, more Boston-accessible housing, and more commuting options for everyone, all of which would make my stupid lefty heart swell with pride.

And for other communities adjacent to the Commuter Rail system, an upgrade is _long_ overdue. The Fairmont Line runs through dense and transit-dependent areas of Boston that would massively benefit from more frequent service. The Newburyport/Rockport runs through Chelsea and Lynn, which have struggled in the past half-century and where recent immigrants and longtime residents alike struggle to efficiently commute to their jobs in Boston. If we don't upgrade the Commuter Rail to S-Bahn style service, we'll need to find other, more expensive solutions to serve these areas properly.

## Capacity for the 21st century
I've just outlined the benefits that frequent, RER-style service can provide to Greater Boston, but it's fair to ask why we need the NSRL to enable this -- can't we just run trains more frequently on existing tracks?

It turns out that we really can't do this in a meaningful way. There are many reasons why Commuter Rail trains run infrequently, in particular the cost of staffing, but the biggest problem is that you can only fit so many trains into North or South Station (what we'd call a "stub-end terminal") at a time. This is why the MBTA is currently planning the South Station Expansion (SSX) project to add seven new tracks to South Station at the cost of about $2 billion. _The_ major benefit of the Link is that connecting North and South stations removes the bottleneck of stub-ends from the system, allowing commuter trains to pass through the core of the system just like the subway already does. In fact, this new service pattern would effectively create a new subway line for downtown Boston, allowing riders to travel between North Station, South Station, and Back Bay with unprecedented ease and relieving stress from overcrowded downtown transfer stations.

There are some secondary capacity improvements that the NSRL would enable as well. For example, any trains that run through the Link would have to run on electric power, which would mean they could accelerate faster and reach their destinations more quickly than the existing diesel locomotives. Retrofitting platforms to permit level boarding (aligning platform and train heights to eliminate flip-out boarding staircases) would reduce time spent at stations.

I can't emphasize enough that all of these benefits can and should be viewed as an alternative to South Station expansion, which is well on its way to becoming reality, but is little more than a band-aid on the capacity problem -- eventually, we'll require even more tracks and even more valuable downtown real estate. Cities across the world have realized that the only viable way to support frequent regional rail is to run the trains _through_ the core rather than parking them there.
