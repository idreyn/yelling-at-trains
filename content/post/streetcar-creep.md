teaser: "The Twin Cities is finally bringing the streetcars back. But time hasn't stood still since they last ran down our streets, and they might not be the best investment."

Growing up in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area, I was taught from a young age that our neighborhoods used to be blanketed by a dense network of streetcars. In high school, our assigned reading included a novel called, _[Until they Bring the Streetcars Back](https://www.amazon.com/Until-They-Bring-Streetcars-Back/dp/0965624765)_, in which the removal of streetcars from 1950s Saint Paul helps set the scene for a frankly terrifying murder mystery that we really could have done without. All this to say, streetcars are held with a certain reverence in the Twin Cities' collective imagination.

This plays the advantage of a couple of transit projects on the Cities' long-term hitlist: 

- **the Nicollet-Central streetcar** that would run through downtown Minneapolis and into Northeast.
- **the Greenway streetcar** that would run east to west along our very good bike trail that parallels Lake Street, connecting to the Blue Line and Green Line light rail.
- **the Riverview streetcar** paralleling the Mississippi along Saint Paul's West 7th street that girds the city's southern extent before crossing the river and linking up with the Blue Line at the airport.

Among these proposals, only the Riverview project is getting serious attention at the moment. Unfortunately, this project is Bad and should be cancelled now.
