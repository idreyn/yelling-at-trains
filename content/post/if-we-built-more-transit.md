Building new transit in America costs an absurd amount of money. By the numbers, it's pretty bleak, with subway and light rail projects costing X and Y times as much per mile as their counterparts in Europe and Asia. Understanding and addressing this problem is the white whale of American transit planning. There are no shortage of contributing factors -- minimizing traffic disruption, the cost of land acquisition in a real estate boom, labor agreements that result in massive overstaffing of construction sites, a tendency to overdesign. A combination of these will plague every transit project, based on conditions unique to each agency and region. A Greater Greater Washington article by John Ricco called _[If we lowered construction costs, we could build more transit](https://ggwash.org/view/40377/if-we-lowered-transit-construction-costs-we-could-build-more-transit)_ does a good job at succinctly summarizing these factors, and rightfully points out that addressing them is prerequisite to every building significant amounts of new subway in our country.

Ricco's thesis is one half of a virtuous cycle, the other half of which is: _if we built more transit, we could lower construction costs_. New subway construction in America, like New York's Second Avenue Subway or San Francisco's Central Subway, is rare enough that it's practically a once-in-a-generation affair in most cities. Because of this, every team that carries it out -- really, a complicated web of public agencies and private contractors -- is learning by doing, making mistakes and growing expertise at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. In other words, we pay the startup cost of learning to build transit every time we attempt to do so. This is especially true on the public agency side; while construction megafirms like Skanska or Fluor may bounce from city to city building transit, the local agencies that hire them have very few domain experts on staff to provide them with clear guidelines or, frankly, to call them out on their bullshit.

I'd like to lay out my thinking here on how "buying transit in bulk" would improve the dismal state of transit construction here in the States. I recognize that it's one thing to identify the problem and sketch out some solutions; it's quite another to build the political will and funding mechanism to actually make this happen. As we'll see, though, cities in our backyard like Seattle and Los Angeles are perhaps inadvertently putting this theory to the test, and my hope is that watching them combat the vicious cycle of mismanagement and cost overrun that currently plagues other cities will provide another argument in favor of large-scale, continuous investment in building transit, rather than the timid, piecemeal expansions we see today. Every transit agency in America has a different relationship with the cities it serves and the layers of government that manage it, so I want to be careful about making sweeping claims about how they work or what they could do better. For now, I'll focus on Boston's MBTA, an agency that's near, and dear(?), to my heart.

## A case study: Boston's Green Line Extension

I don't want to be the one to jinx it, but the MBTA appears to really be building the Green Line Extension (GLX) to Somerville, finally fulfilling a prophecy inscribed on a mysterious ivory dagger excavated during the Big Dig. This is the agency's first urban rail expansion since the _mid 1980s_ when the Red Line was extended as far northwest as good ol' fashioned Catholic racism would permit, and it came very close to not happening at all. In 2015, the MBTA announced that the budget for the project was spiraling out of control. Already at $2.2 billion for 4.7 miles of light rail (along an existing right-of-way occupied by commuter trains!) the agency projected cost increases of another billion dollars. Consultants were hired to point out that this was very expensive, and contracts were terminated with White-Skanska-Kiewit (WSK), the rolling ball of construction firms in charge of the extension.

This was a moment of reckoning for the MBTA. The GLX project was supposed to benefit from an innovative new "design-build" project managment technique, where the same contractor responsible for designing the extension is also responsible for (get this) building it. This seems so sensible that it almost seems silly to give it a name[^1], but in the case of GLX it allowed the MBTA to become deeply overreliant on WSK to assess the true cost of the project. While the budget's line items certainly added up to the new quoted figure, the ask -- now about $3 billion for what could flippantly be described as some trolley tracks in a pre-built trench, had exited even the exosphere of reasonableness. No one at the MBTA understood the cause of the cost increases well enough to negotiate them back down, and what remained was to give up and try again, leaving hundreds of millions in sunk cost on the table. Two years later, in 2017, the agency scaled back some of their more ambitious plans, and a new rolling ball of firms styling themselves GLX Contractors picked up the mantle, promising to deliver the project for a billion less than the figure that WSK had quoted and putting the Green Line Extension back on track for completion.

So while this story has a happy ending, in some ways, the epilogue is bittersweet. The line opens -- there's confetti and a ribbon-cutton ceremony with cute transit-themed cupcakes. Someone updates their Green Line Bar Crawl map, and Reddit gets into a fight over whether Aeronaut Brewing is overrated hipster garbage. And over at the MBTA, an absolutely massive undertaking winds down and shuts off the lights. People who have spent the last five years learning how to effectively wield design-build to deliver a light rail line -- how to streamline writing legal boilerplate, how to draw up exacting specifications for elevator functionality, who to call when digging crews hit an unexpected utility line -- will go home and move on with their lives. When the MBTA next gets the wherewithal to build more rail (and it has no concrete plans to do so through 2040) all of the relationships and expertise built up on the job during GLX will have to be rebuilt from scratch, at the cost of many thousands of person-hours and millions of dollars.

Keeping design and construction expertise in-house could promote decision making that's budget-conscious and well informed by local conditions. But it's only cost-effective to retain such experts in a world where they stay busy because [we always have a subway under construction](https://medium.com/art-marketing/san-francisco-should-always-have-a-subway-under-construction-76d3ddf481c1).

## Buying transit in bulk

The MBTA is an agency with expertise transit _operations_ that occasionally indulges in project management for transit _construction_. Its role in the process is both central and somewhat limited, it channels decisions and funding from

Every decision has a cost.

Partnerships, not transactions -- incentive on the part of contractors to build lasting relationships rather than make the most of their time in the "money pit".

## What if we just kept digging?

Everything here is predicated on the idea of a _transit project_ -- a discrete unit of work with its own budget, plan and deadline. I'm not here to argue against the notion of projects, without which any kind of planning effort would be rather lost, but 

Build the system, not the line.
