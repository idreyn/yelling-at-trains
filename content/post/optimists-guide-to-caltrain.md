As a millenial I am totally still a young person[^0], and am therefore duly familiar with the concept of the ["Glo-Up"](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/glo-up), in which a person documents their transformation as they become the best version of themselves. If you're anything like me, and nothing like a normal person, you may enjoy watching a similar thing happen as transit systems grow and evolve, serving more people faster and more efficiently. Buckle up, fellow kids; this is the story of how an unassuming commuter railway might just beat the neighboring subway system to become the gold standard in regional transit, one small improvement at a time.

Bay Area commuters, as well as people who read the title of this post, may have already guessed that I'm talking about Caltrain, the commuter rail line that carries me and about 30,000 other daily passengers between San Francisco and Silicon Valley. As the only extant rail link between these two great symbols of man's hubris, the system is an indispensable alternative to the 101 freeway, which during the morning is a soup of Google shuttle buses and too-clever-by-half Teslas algorithmically jockeying for open lanes. It's also long lived in the shadow of BART, our regional rapid transit network. Caltrain goes where BART doesn't, and the great lament of Bay Area transit nerdery is that BART doesn't ring the bay, and instead of its fast, frequent, electric trains, Silicon Valley is stuck with slow, sparse, diesel Caltrain service.

Yet for all its shortcomings, Caltrain is in some ways a victim of its own success. Ridership has more than doubled in the past ten years, trains are packed to the gills during peak commute times, and between the diesel trains, numerous grade crossings, and sparse off-peak service, Caltrain's weary, twentieth-century bones are starting to show. Luckily, after decades of stops and starts, an Alpha-Bits box of ballot measures, and [a harrowing run-in with transportation secretary Elaine Chao](https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/05/22/federal-fta-grant-caltrain-electrification/), Caltrain is about to receive a slate of major upgrades, starting with the Caltrain Modernization ("CalMod") project to run quieter, faster, greener electric trains. Unsurpringly, the construction work required is going to make service worse in the short-term, starting with cessation of weekend service within San Francisco on October 6, 2018.

What do we get for these disruptions? My hope is that we're taking the first steps towards Caltrain matching and maybe even exceeding BART in frequency, speed, and comfort (okay, that last one shouldn't be that hard). And since one rationale for improving Caltrain is that its tracks will eventually, maybe, _inshallah_, be shared by the beleaguered [California High Speed Rail project](https://cal.streetsblog.org/2018/08/01/trying-to-find-the-truth-in-the-latest-la-times-ny-times-ca-high-speed-rail-pieces/) -- henceforth _CAHSR_ because my fingers hurt -- we have a chance to lay the groundwork for a "blended" rail system where local and express Caltrain service happily coexists with high speed rail, sharing tracks, platforms, and maybe even a unified fare system. While electrification is a prerequisite for this optimistic future, I hope that your takeaway from reading this is that _electrifcation is just the beginning_ of Caltrain's transformation from ugly duckling to utilitarian but highly effective adult duck (metaphors were never my strong suit). As Caltrain commuters, we need to be aware of what specific investments mean in human terms, so we can talk about, evaluate, and advocate for them. Adding up all the changes slated for the next decade or so, we have a lot to look forward to -- and BART had better watch its back.

## Danger! High Voltage!

If you're looking to blow an entire afternoon, you should check out the whole YouTube genre of electric car owners (including [Electric Car Owner Number One](https://www.theonion.com/literally-no-one-calls-me-that-or-has-ever-called-me-t-1819592848)) demonstrating how their cars' induction motors blow the zero-to-sixty of traditional internal combustion engines out of the water. This neat (and probably dangerous) quirk of EVs turns out to be the primary benefit of electric _trains_ over their diesel-guzzling brethren. Faster acceleration means it's possible for trains to spend more time at their maximum allowed speed, which is particularly important when you make as many stops -- 21! -- as your local Caltrain does between San Francisco and San Jose. [While it's possible that electricty was known to the ancient Persians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad_Battery), American commuter railways have with relatively few exceptions failed to catch on to this mysterious phenomenon as a means of train propulsion. Railways in other parts of the world use trains called Electric Multiple Unit (EMUs, and not [this kind](http://cdn.iflscience.com/images/8b2e1af6-c2af-5ea7-91e4-6918b1811e3b/content-1492444700-emu-war.jpg)), where each car draws power from an overhead wire and carries its own motors. Since each car propels itself, you can string them together with reckless abandon without really affecting their ability to accelerate quicky.

<figure class="img-small">
    <img src="/images/caltrain-charts/electrification.png"/>
    <figcaption>
        Local trains that make all stops will benefit much more from electrification, since they spend more time accelerating and decelerating than express ("Baby Bullet") trains.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

For a few reasons, these are less common in the United States. First and foremost, we don't deserve nice things. More practically, commuter systems such as Caltrain often share track with much heavier freight trains. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has more stringent standards for train "crashworthiness" than in other countries â€” and most EMUs don't meet these standards, though they operate just fine in similar conditions in Europe. By committing to further safety improvements, loudly reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, and promising to stop affectionately referring to Colin Kapernick as "Kap", Caltrain was able to procure an waiver from the federal government that permits them to buy and run European EMUs. We now have 96 Stadler "KISS" EMUs _en route_, and we'll likely be purchasing another batch of 96 in the next few years. Don't start refreshing the delivery tracker just yet, though -- the trains won't get here until 2020 and won't be running until late 2021 at the earliest.

    </figcaption>
</figure>


One point that seems to have gotten lost in the hubbub is that our Stadler EMUs require more onboard space for transformers and shit, and don't have as much seating capacity as any of the existing Caltrain cars; they'll average [681 seats per 6-car train instead of today's 741](http://www.caltrain.com/Assets/Caltrain+Modernization+Program/Electric+Multiple+Units/EMU+Capacity+Details_SeatsStandeesBikes+Feb+2018.pdf). To make up for this, Caltrain can and will run more peak-hour trains after the EMU procurement -- according to its projected timetables, anyway -- and in fact most express service will continue to use the existing diesel trains until the second batch of EMUs comes in. Caltrain projects a peak capacity increase of 10%, and this number jumps to 31% counting standing-room-only[^2]. Nothing to panic about, but it underscores the fact that really tapping into Caltrain's potential capacity involves two of the oldest tricks in the book: running trains more frequently and _[shuffling papers]_ making the trains longer[^3].

## Positive train control

Remember that part about not crashing into freight trains? Just like cars, trains are subject to speed limits and traffic signals, but since [an accident in 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Chatsworth_train_collision), our friends at the FRA have gotten serious about enforcing these rules with computers instead of just [two dudes pointing at things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av_Kkh3mp4E). This is called _Positive Train Control_, or just PTC -- a system that accounts for things like track curvature, road crossings, and other trains in order to calculate and enforce a speed limit for each train in real time. While PTC isn't a new thing and there are plenty of existing implementations, Caltrain initially took it upon themselves to design an entirely new system called CBOSS. Though widely considered a risky move, the $261 million project was completed on time and under budget.

<figure class="img">
    <img src="/images/cboss.gif" alt="A visual depiction of PTC from Caltrain, featuring a train, a satellite, a trackside signal, and a dispatch center linked within a swirling red circle."/>
    <figcaption>
        Okay, there's trains, and...train signals. And a satellite, I think? We'll work out the details later, jeez.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

Haha, no, I was just joking. After about six years of missed deadlines and slipping budgets, the agency has basically thrown its hands in the air and decided to pay for implementation of a standard PTC system called I-ETMS, in the hopes of meeting a December 2018 deadline for demonstating the technology in operation. Not all of the money spent on CBOSS was wasted, since a lot of the electronics can be reused, but [Caltrain expert Clem Tillier ran the numbers](http://caltrain-hsr.blogspot.com/2018/02/the-end-of-cboss.html)[^3] and determined that the agency lit about $150 million in tax dollars on fire trying and failing to get CBOSS up to snuff. Okay, bad, but I still haven't answered your question: what _is_ positive train control, and what is this cool quarter billion dollars going to get us?

<figure class="img">
    <img src="/images/caltrain-charts/ptc.png"/>
    <figcaption>
        Positive train control gives us more confident readings on train position and velocity (eat your heart out, Heisenberg!) which reduces the required safety margins between trains.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

You can't point to a single object and say "that's PTC", which ultimately makes it an inevitable budget black hole -- when nothing's PTC, _everything_ is. I'll try my best though: it's a series of electronic sensors, both trackside and on trains, as well as complicated monitoring and dispatch software, and a series of protocols for using all of this technology correctly. Put together, it basically gives us higher confidence in where trains are and how fast they're going, because it imposes a strict speed limit with computers -- but encourages operators to maximize performance within that limit! Electrification and PTC are the two major line items in the "CalMod" project that's currently underway, and they'll go a long way in helping Caltrain keep up with growing demand. For further improvements, we'll need to dive into project that are murky, speculative, and (gasp) unfunded.

## Level boarding

Can we make the train faster when it's _not_ moving? Sounds like a zen koan, but consider this: Caltrain got some consultants to go out and watch their trains pull into stations for a few weeks, and these poor souls reported a systemwide median _dwell time_ (time stopped at a station) of 48 seconds. That adds up to _more than 15 minutes of standstill_ on a local train. Not only do we need to account for dwell time when spacing trains out, but it also depends on passenger volume, so we can't really know in advance how much any stop is going to require. Sure, Millbrae in the mornings is always going to be busy thanks to its BART connection, and no one will ever get on or off at Hillsdale because it's haunted, but there's a certain amount of padding built in to account for extremely heavy passenger loads, or passengers who need assistance boarding with a wheelchair. Our tool for shortening dwell times is _level boarding_: train doors and platforms built to the exact same height so that you can board and alight without encountering a step, whether you walk, wheel, slither, or wumbo on board. This makes dwell times shorter and more predictable -- in a very real sense, it makes the trains faster at zero miles per hour.

<figure class="img-small">
    <img src="/images/caltrain-charts/level-boarding.png"/>
    <figcaption>
        Level boarding shortens the dwell times at stations (horizontal grey lines). This subject could be a blog post all on its own, but as an aside I'll mention that it would help make BART-style, down-to-the-minute cross-platform transfers between local and express service more feasible, given the right station to support it.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

Since some of Caltrain's platforms will be shared with CAHSR, implementing level boarding requires some forethought. CAHSR trains will have level boarding at 50" above the rail, so Caltrain _needs_ doors at that height. Right now, though, Caltrain platforms are at 8" -- and a staircase between those two heights would be prohibitively steep. The upgrade of both trains and platforms will be a long, iterative process -- how will we manage in these years of transition? A firelit boardroom full of old men in suits gnaw at their cigars, turning the question over in their mind. Then: _"what if we had two sets of doors on the train?"_, the Caltrain intern volunteers shakily from across the room. By jove, the whippersnapper's done it!

Sure enough, the Stadler EMUs are designed with two sets of doors, at 25" and 50", to faciliate low-step boarding today while also preparing for a future of compatibility with HSR. While its vehicles are at least future-proofed, Caltrain has been having trouble ironing out the details of which stations are going to get level boarding at what height, when. Because of CASHR, we're going to have to rebuild the platforms at major stations at least once, raising them to 50" and lengthening them to support longer high-speed trains. It would be nice if this could happen exactly once in the next few decades, but given that high speed rail may not make it to the Bay until sometime beginning with "stardate", we should be prepared to press on with or without it.

    </figcaption>
</figure>

There is some latent danger here of bad operations permanently hamstringing a very expensive concrete investment. One potential outcome is that Caltrain builds 25" platforms without a plan to eventually convert them to 50". In this case, we could end up segregating HSR and Caltrain trains onto different sets of platforms, forcing us to overbuild terminals while also preventing us from using them to their full capacity. Actually understanding Caltrain's perspective on this issue requires advanced spelunking their meeting notes and planning documents, [so I rely (again) on Clem Tillier to keep me up to date on how they're doing](http://caltrain-hsr.blogspot.com/2018/09/still-dithering-on-level-boarding.html?showComment=1537756163104#c2590175445406246593). Getting level boarding right is priority #1 for correctly "blending" Caltrain and HSR operations, and applying gentle pressure on Caltrain to get their shit together and finalize a plan for when and how platforms will be raised is something we can all do next time they walk around the trains handing out survey cards.

## To Transbay and beyond

And before we dive into the technical details, let's keep in mind why any of this should matter to the 99% of people who don't normally get a kick out of reading about their commute on their commute. For better or worse, the peninsula stretching from San Francisco to San Jose is one of the wealthiest and most economically productive places in the world. No one planned for this, but the advent of the semiconductor occured during a time when it seemed reasonable, even utopian, to build sprawling corporate campuses accessible primarily by freeway travel. The alienating, insular ethos of consumer technology, increasingly exported into our daily lives by the likes of Uber and Facebook, seems to reflect the built environment of the Valley itself. Living here day to day, I am often struck by how unsustainable it all seems -- the fantastic opulence and technical expertise siloed up in towers of sheer indifference towards solving the basic problems of housing and transportation in the communities used as a substrate. Anything that can make this place feel more connected, accessible, equitable -- more like a _place_ -- to me increasingly seems like an investment in not just the Bay Area, but everywhere that lies in the long shadows of Apple and Google's walled gardens.

Jesus, I need another coffee. Anyway, we were talking about trains, right?
