			This post is weeks late and doesn&rsquo;t have that much to do with transit, but is about a city I love and have been very proud to live in for the past four years. I just finished an internship with the MTA in New York so I will probably be back to my regularly scheduled yelling at trains soon.
A few weeks ago, my MIT inbox dinged with a piece of exciting news &mdash; President Reif announced that the university has secured the rights to redevelop a huge part of adjacent Kendall Square that is currently owned by the US Department of Transportation.

			Do the people who plan your city&rsquo;s transit system watch basketball or soccer? It&rsquo;s a question that probably doesn&rsquo;t come up much at community feedback meetings, and yet when we look at the way money is spent on transit in America, it might be wise to pause for a second and consider what sports metaphors are rattling around the brains of the planning community.1 On the surface, basketball and soccer may appear to be just two variants of sportsball, in which a group of people work hard to put some kind of ball in some kind of net more times than their opponent.

			For a long time I have been very vocal about transportation issues to my very forgiving friends and family. I&rsquo;ve decided that rather than subject them to this madness directly I should start a blog &ndash; this will also serve to help me practice writing clearly and organize my thoughts. I suspect this blog will mostly stay related to transit and urbanism since I spent so much time on the wonderful graphic in the header, but we&rsquo;ll see what becomes of it.
