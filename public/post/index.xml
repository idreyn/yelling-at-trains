      <title>Boston&#39;s Red-Blue Connector is a state-of-good-repair problem</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When transit advocates in Boston call for expansions of the T, the standard response from on high is that for the foreseeable future, we need to focus on what the FTA calls &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.transit.dot.gov/regulations-and-guidance/asset-management/state-good-repair&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;State of Good Repair&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; keeping our existing track, stations, and vehicles in decent condition. While this can sometimes feel like a &amp;ldquo;shove off, we don&amp;rsquo;t have the money&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s a pragmatic stance, and to their credit, the MBTA is actually in the middle of a push for such investment, with orders for new Red and Orange Line cars in the works and improved signaling and winterization schemes in the pipeline. By and large, prioritizing maintenance over expansion is a sound principle and I am not here to challenge it. Instead, I want to dig a bit deeper into the assumptions made when dichotomizing capital investments into &amp;ldquo;expansion&amp;rdquo; versus &amp;ldquo;maintenance&amp;rdquo;. Broadly speaking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expansion&lt;/strong&gt; means new revenue service to new places, adding new transit users to the system and putting additional stress on existing infrastructure. We can&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;do&amp;rdquo; expansion right now because it would be unsustainable and irresponsible to redirect resources to new parts of the system when existing ones are not being adequately maintained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance&lt;/strong&gt; means making investments that will allow us to more effectively use the infrastructure we already have. It means updating outdated technologies (like switching from block signaling to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications-based_train_control&#34;&gt;communications-based train control&lt;/a&gt;) and fixing historic mistakes (oh god the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Line_(MBTA)#/media/File:Longwood_MBTA_station,_Brookline_MA.jpg&#34;&gt;Type 8&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;) that have caused inefficiency to creep into the system over time. Generally speaking this means not adding new riders &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;, although it might increase the overall capacity of the system. Capital investment in this category must be ongoing and sustainable, and we have a lot of backlog here to slog through before we can think about &amp;ldquo;expansion&amp;rdquo;. Specific examples include: modernizing signaling systems, replacing rolling stock, cleaning and modernizing stations, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This distinction has found its way into a lot of discussion over transit investment in Boston and other cities with legacy systems. I wish to pose the question of whether a project might exist that is incorrectly categorized as reckless expansion when it actually lives much closer on the spectrum to &amp;ldquo;sound maintenance&amp;rdquo; projects like new signaling systems and the Government Center overhaul. I think the Red-Blue connector is such a project.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://yelling-at-trains.org/images/missing-blue-segment.png&#34; alt=&#34;The distance between Bowdoin, the Blue Line&amp;#39;s current terminus, and the Charles/MGH Red Line station. Let&amp;#39;s all stare at this image and collectively will the black segment into existence.&#34; /&gt;

        The distance between Bowdoin, the Blue Line&amp;#39;s current terminus, and the Charles/MGH Red Line station. Let&amp;#39;s all stare at this image and collectively will the black segment into existence.
        
            
        
        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The fact that the Red and Blue lines don&amp;rsquo;t connect, even though the Blue Line terminates about 2,000 feet from Charles/MGH, is a head-scratcher for tourists, frustration for commuters, and increasingly, a bottleneck on the capacity of our core subway system. Though the state was made to study the option as a Big Dig mitigation project, it was deemed too expensive and shelved, though the $750 million price tag given by MassDOT is for an &lt;a href=&#34;http://amateurplanner.blogspot.com/2016/09/how-massdot-stacks-deck-red-blue-edition_7.html&#34;&gt;absurdly over-engineered version&lt;/a&gt; that would make it the most expensive piece of subway per mile in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the actual price of construction, the price of ignoring Red-Blue is becoming increasingly apparent as our core stations groan under the weight of over 100,000  daily transfers&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:This-is-the-tota&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:This-is-the-tota&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Because of its absence, commuters treat the existing downtown transfer stations as a sort of superstation where the Green and Orange lines serve as a glorified moving walkway&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:Hong-Kong-has-an&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:Hong-Kong-has-an&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to get between Red and Blue platforms. The increased footfall puts stress on stations like Park Street and Government Center and overcrowds the barely adequate Red, Green, and Orange line cars while the Blue Line cruises around far under capacity downtown. This crowding has ripple effects throughout the system; at a Kendall Square Mobility Task Force meeting I attended (awkwardly sat in the back of and ate four oatmeal cookies) it was mentioned that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cambridgema.gov/cdd/projects/transportation/~/media/C7942C92FA4B4551B7DD54B1D831CE5B.ashx&#34;&gt;variability of train dwell times at Park Street is a primary bottleneck for throughput on the Red Line&lt;/a&gt;. Extending the Blue Line about half a mile would improve the capacity of every other subway line in the system by better balancing the flow of downtown commuters throughout existing stations. &lt;em&gt;It lets us use our existing infrastructure more effectively&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; sounds familiar, no?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://yelling-at-trains.org/images/blue-line-shirt.png&#34; alt=&#34;I want this on a shirt, but no one will print it for me because trademarks&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A Red-Blue transfer is not a &amp;ldquo;would be nice someday&amp;rdquo; like the North-South Rail Link or a Green Line connection to the Seaport. It&amp;rsquo;s not even an I Can&amp;rsquo;t Believe It&amp;rsquo;s Not Built Yetâ„¢ in the same vein as the Blue Line to Lynn. The fact that these two lines don&amp;rsquo;t connect is a fundamental shortcoming of the topology of our subway network. When Governor Baker and the Fiscal and Managment Control Board triage the problems that the MBTA faces today, the Red-Blue connector needs to be bucketed not with other subway extensions, but with issues like vehicle procurement and signaling upgrades, and maybe just a notch below &amp;ldquo;the trains are literally on fire&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s an embarrassment that deserves our full attention the moment the Green Line Extension checks clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:This-is-the-tota&#34;&gt;This is the total number of Red-Green and Red-Orange transfers as given at the bottom of page 16 of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mbta.com/uploadedfiles/documents/2014%20BLUEBOOK%2014th%20Edition(1).pdf&#34;&gt;2014 MBTA Blue Book.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:This-is-the-tota&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:Hong-Kong-has-an&#34;&gt;Hong Kong has an actual moving walkway between its adjacent Central and Admiralty stations, and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty cool. I have been told by folks at the T that an equivalent connector between State Street and Downtown Crossing is probably impossible due to the geometry of the stations. &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:Hong-Kong-has-an&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Disrupt Kendall Square!</title>
      <link>http://yelling-at-trains.org/post/disrupt-kendall/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2017 11:00:00 -0500</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, my MIT inbox dinged with a piece of exciting news &amp;mdash; President Reif announced that the university has secured the rights to redevelop a huge part of adjacent Kendall Square that is currently owned by the US Department of Transportation. Kendall is the epicenter of Cambridge&amp;rsquo;s tech community and even if you spend as much time pounding down overpriced quinoa bowls there as I do, you may not be aware that the USDOT&amp;rsquo;s Volpe Center research facility is tucked right behind the Marriott on Broadway, in an imposing but mostly nondescript building that you can&amp;rsquo;t get into without a passport and a blood sample. This is a huge opportunity &amp;mdash; maybe our last opportunity &amp;mdash; to start building a real neighborhood out of what could currently be better described as a gleaming pileup of biotech buildings. MIT treasurer Israel Ruiz laid out MIT&amp;rsquo;s broad vision in &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.mit.edu/2017/3q-israel-ruiz-investment-volpe-center-0118&#34;&gt;an interview with MIT News&lt;/a&gt; where, perhaps in an attempt to spot-fix a game of Silicon Valley buzzword bingo, he used the phrase &amp;ldquo;innovation ecosystem&amp;rdquo; five times in the space of three questions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://yelling-at-trains.org/images/middle-out.png&#34; alt=&#34;Pictured: MIT trying to figure out how many times it can fit the word &amp;#39;innovate&amp;#39; into a single press release&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip;startups, accelerators, hacker lofts&amp;hellip;more of the same, huh? And yet, snark aside, there&amp;rsquo;s evidence here and elsewhere that MIT is seriously committed to transforming Kendall a complete place to work and live. In the same interview, Ruiz asserted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our engagement with the Volpe property will allow us to further contribute to the vibrancy of the Kendall Square area &amp;mdash; which will provide long-term benefits for our neighbors, for the city, and for the Institute itself. Our work with the Volpe parcel will contribute to an even more exciting Kendall Square for members of the broader community to live and work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have visited Kendall and its fellow squares on the Red Line (Central, Harvard, Porter, and Davis), it&amp;rsquo;s easy to sense the vibrancy that, by comparison, MIT feels Kendall missing. But this is so hard to quantify &amp;mdash; what makes a neighborhood &lt;em&gt;vibrant&lt;/em&gt;, anyway? Rooftop bars? Old people feeding birds? It&amp;rsquo;s something you know when you see; difficult to create in a laboratory like the Seaport, but all too easy to bulldoze over in a place like Boston&amp;rsquo;s old West End. Vibrancy is the surprising sights and interactions that are hallmarks of life in the city, something offbeat in a lockstep world. The places that best fit this description are those that not only attract people from all walks of life, they give them an opportunity to add something of their own. Can MIT pull this off in Kendall Square? How badly does it want to? While I recognize that MIT wants both a return on its investment and to solidify Kendall as an &amp;ldquo;innovation hub&amp;rdquo;, I hope they won&amp;rsquo;t forget that in a place made of concrete, glass, and venture capital, the most disruptive additions might be simple, unassuming, and human.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://yelling-at-trains.org/images/kendall-primer.png&#34; alt=&#34;A quick geographic primer.

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://news.mit.edu/2017/agreement-redevelop-volpe-center-kendall-square-0118&#34;&gt;Per the press release&lt;/a&gt;, MIT will build a new four-acre building for USDOT on the 14-acre property and following this will have the other ten acres to reshape in its image. Doing this right won&amp;rsquo;t be easy, but it will be well-informed by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cambridgema.gov/cdd/projects/planning/k2c2&#34;&gt;K2/C2&lt;/a&gt; study done by Cambridge and MIT in 2013 to evaluate the future of Central and Kendall Squares. Even now, MIT is preparing to &lt;a href=&#34;http://kendallsquare.mit.edu/&#34;&gt;redevelop a huge part of Main Street&lt;/a&gt; with a half-dozen or so mixed-use buildings, which will make a big impact on the neighborhood well before the Volpe parcel sees serious work. It&amp;rsquo;s also important to note that this property is a $750 million investment on MIT&amp;rsquo;s part, so it will be paying taxes on the property and trying to put things there that will make it money, presumably so it can tear up and re-sod all of its grass a few more times each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all that said, I&amp;rsquo;d like to outline a few of my own thoughts about how to make Kendall Square a more interesting, functional, and inclusive &lt;em&gt;place&lt;/em&gt;. So without further ado, here&amp;rsquo;s a listicle called &amp;ldquo;10 Crazy Things MIT Can Do To #Disrupt Kendall Square&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;1-human-scale-streetscapes&#34;&gt;1. Human-scale streetscapes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kendall is notorious for its buildings that look nice from a distance, but offer nothing to passers-by besides views into their spotless lobbies and  abstract LED art installed to comply with development regulations requiring &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; at street-level. The result is that the streets around these buildings are windswept and uninviting, particularly Broadway and Binney, and become non-places that people hurry though instead of lingering in. This isn&amp;rsquo;t true everywhere in Kendall, nor is it a problem that Volpe can solve on its own, but while what ultimately goes up there will probably be glassy and imposing, MIT should still carve out some space for a larger number of smaller, street-facing shops. Another thing that makes Kendall circa 2017 so imposing is the length of certain blocks &amp;mdash; for instance, the 1,000 feet of Main Street on the edge of campus has no cross-cuts onto adjacent Broadway except through a hotel lobby. Perhaps a new street&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1-I-am-being-tol&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1-I-am-being-tol&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; could bisect the current Volpe parcel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://yelling-at-trains.org/images/binney.png&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        This looks like a nice place for nothing to happen ever.
        &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/maps/@42.366014,-71.0855289,3a,75y,46.4h,98.18t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1szoO1qbSpY_NmjWMwDC94eg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656&#34;&gt;Source via Google Maps&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;2-plant-life&#34;&gt;2. Plant life&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of my fellow humans tell me that green space is another nice thing to have in a neighborhood. Kendall isn&amp;rsquo;t the grassiest place in the world, but it does have a few patches here and there; the square of grass in front of the Marriot is actually quite nice, especially if you like being surround on all sides by pigeons. The greenest place in the neighborhood is actually the existing Volpe parcel, which is too bad because there&amp;rsquo;s currently a big fence and armed federal employees preventing anyone from having a picnic or tossing the proverbial disk there. Though MIT will certainly reduce the total amount of grass in the parcel, leaving any of it accessible to the public would be a net win, especially if they can create a park-like space with a distinguishing landmark, like a water fountain, public art, or performance space. The Rose Kennedy greenway over in Boston presents a successful example of how to create an an effective oasis of green surrounded by slow but persistent traffic on all sides, and could serve as a model for MIT to emulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://yelling-at-trains.org/images/rk-greenway.jpg&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        Parts of the Greenway close to South Station use foliage nicely to buffer the green space from traffic on both sides.

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;3-let-them-eat-something-other-than-cake&#34;&gt;3. Let them eat something other than cake&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where Kendall Square does have anything at sidewalk level, it caters mostly to the immediate needs employees of the area, offering organic lunch options, wine bars, and inexplicably a chain of two coffee shops called Tatte within spitting distance of each other. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with upscale dining, but that&amp;rsquo;s almost literally all Kendall has, which is apparent in those rare instances where you need a toothbrush or a dozen eggs but not a $15 Moscow mule. This unfulfillment of basic life needs affects people who live in Kendall proper, one of the more residential areas nearby, or even in MIT housing. For instance, here&amp;rsquo;s what Google Maps shows for grocery stores in the area:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://yelling-at-trains.org/images/no-grocery-stores.png&#34; alt=&#34;They don&amp;#39;t want you to eat.&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
        They don&amp;#39;t want you to eat.
        
            
        
        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The nearest grocery stores, running the gamut on scale and price, all seem to form a ring set back a mile or so from Kendall, as if some mad scientist at Biogen accidentally created a force field that only repels fresh produce. Compare this situation to the Back Bay and West End areas, screenshotted below. This is not an apples-to-apples comparison (note that the scales are different and arbitrary) but to show that this is not the norm even in pricey areas across the river.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://yelling-at-trains.org/images/grocery-stores.png&#34; alt=&#34;Stay tuned for my next post about how Kendall needs an &amp;#39;adult bakery&amp;#39;&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
        Stay tuned for my next post about how Kendall needs an &amp;#39;adult bakery&amp;#39;
        
            
        
        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Kendall is basically a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_desert&#34;&gt;food desert&lt;/a&gt;, a term more commonly associated with impoverished neighborhoods than the biotech capital of the East Coast.  If a regular grocery store is too boring for MIT, this might be a fun place for a semi-enclosed farmer&amp;rsquo;s market, or something like Minneapolis&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.midtownglobalmarket.org/&#34;&gt;Midtown Global Market&lt;/a&gt; which showcases cuisines from around the world. Or MIT can build the grocery store of the future, featuring the latest in hydroponics technology, interactive displays on nutrition and food sourcing, and some Amazon Go-style AI where the store automatically rings out your items as you take them off the shelf and also admonishes you for not buying the healthier soy sauce.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://yelling-at-trains.org/images/hal.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;I&amp;#39;m sorry Dave, do you have *any idea* how much sodium is in that thing?&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
        I&amp;#39;m sorry Dave, do you have *any idea* how much sodium is in that thing?
        
            
        
        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The same goes for pharmacies, convenience stores, maybe a pizza joint. We need to be realistic about what kinds of businesses will survive in Kendall Square, but there are definitely voids to be filled and demand to be induced in these crucial categories. MIT might balk at the idea of using any of its hard-won land for something as mundane CVS or a Dunks, but given the current state of Kendall, either of these things would be more useful than a biotech startup incubator, at least until drones start delivering donuts directly into our mouths. And of course, this is conditioned on what ends up arriving as part of the Main Street development. Hopefully MIT follows through on its promise to bring neighborhood essentials to that parcel soon, so there&amp;rsquo;s less need to try to cram &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; into Volpe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;4-connect-with-the-rest-of-cambridge&#34;&gt;4. Connect with the rest of Cambridge&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a subject that I want to broach carefully, because I haven&amp;rsquo;t lived in Cambridge very long and I can&amp;rsquo;t speak to how MIT&amp;rsquo;s relationship with its host city is perceived by residents near the Institute&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2-Presumably-the&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2-Presumably-the&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. However, my perception is that Kendall Square is a bit of a bubble that blends poorly into the neighboring areas, which are mostly single family housing and have a working-class history. Given that there is public housing abutting some of the newer biotech buildings, wealth inequality is the obvious elephant in this room, but this seems like an issue that cuts across class to some extent; for poor and well-to-do Cantabridgians alike, there aren&amp;rsquo;t all that many reasons to wander into Kendall Square if you don&amp;rsquo;t work there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between real estate tax revenue and &amp;ldquo;payment in lieu of taxes&amp;rdquo; (PILOT), MIT &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.mit.edu/facts/community.html&#34;&gt;contributes about $50 million&lt;/a&gt; back to Cambridge&amp;rsquo;s coffers each year, so its relationship with the city can be called symbiotic, not parasitic. But as it takes a more active role in shaping the city&amp;rsquo;s fate, MIT must also accept some increased responsibility for the goodwill of all of its residents. Its quest to turn Kendall into something resembling a neighborhood will eventually lead it to grapple with tough questions about who it wants to attract to Kendall Square and for what reasons. My opinion is that this is a great opportunity to bring Cambridge into Kendall, and Kendall into Cambridge. Simply installing staples like a grocery store will have this effect, but MIT has never been about doing the bare minimum.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3-Though-my-tran&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3-Though-my-tran&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Is there more we can do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Points for everyone who guessed &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; on that one. For instance, MIT is pretty big into educational outreach &amp;mdash; so much so that they created tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://ocw.mit.edu&#34;&gt;OCW&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://edx.mit.edu&#34;&gt;EdX&lt;/a&gt; to spread knowledge over the internet. If MIT opened a community education center in Kendall Square, it would simply be taking this tradition to the local level. Imagine MIT students and residents of the area coming together to teach and learn classes on astronomy, woodworking, electronics, apiary, hacky sack, whatever. There&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://esp.mit.edu/&#34;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://mitdynamit.weebly.com/&#34;&gt;precedent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://http://scioly.mit.edu/&#34;&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://amphibious.mit.edu/&#34;&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; that MIT students are more than willing to teach things for free (a bunch of know-it-alls, really) and I suspect &lt;a href=&#34;http://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.php?pid=144&#34;&gt;some of the professors&lt;/a&gt; would get in on the fun. Offering a community-run makerspace, after-school tutoring, and a place for lectures open to everyone would be a fantastic way for MIT to ~give back to the community~ and perhaps get Kendall techies and longtime Cambridge residents to mingle a little. Hey, how cool would it be if MIT built a magnet school for local middle/high school students? This could be another place where MIT flexes its innovative muscle, using cutting-edge teaching techniques and &lt;a href=&#34;http://khanlabschool.org/&#34;&gt;running cruel experiments in mastery-based learning and formative assessment&lt;/a&gt;. Or they could just &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.universalhub.com/2016/hundreds-bps-students-walk-out-protest-school&#34;&gt;hire competent teachers and spend enough money to actually buy school supplies&lt;/a&gt;. MIT isn&amp;rsquo;t going to look here to recoup its investment (though it would probably produce a good crop of applicants every year) but it would create a stepping-stone for local students for whom MIT is simultaneously next door and a world away. Plus, it would be a nice thank-you gift to the city that has let us install some &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.mit.edu/facilities/construction/completed/stata.html&#34;&gt;seriously ridiculous buildings&lt;/a&gt; on prime real estate over the past century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;5-think-beyond-the-red-line&#34;&gt;5. Think beyond the Red Line&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if I can go ten paragraphs without mentioning transit. A big factor in Kendall&amp;rsquo;s growing pains is major overcrowding on the Red Line &amp;ndash; trains are regularly &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cambridgema.gov/~/media/Files/CDD/Transportation/transitcommittee/2015/transit_cmte_MITRedLine_Pres_20151007_2.pdf?la=en&#34;&gt;at or over capacity&lt;/a&gt; in peak direction at rush hour. So growing Kendall is a double-edged sword, since every new resident and employee in the neighborhood puts strain on its already maxed-out heavy rail link. In the long term, Kendall is going to need another rapid transit line to take stress off the Red Line &amp;ndash; the most likely candidate is a BRT or LRT line replacing the Grand Junction freight tracks, but that&amp;rsquo;s at least a few decades out.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4-And-arguably-n&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4-And-arguably-n&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In the meantime, before MIT builds anything on top of the Volpe site, it should think carefully about what it can put &lt;em&gt;underneath&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t exactly run the numbers on this&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5-Unresearched-a&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5-Unresearched-a&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but an underground bus terminus with a ramp leading onto Broadway might be a useful thing to have in Kendall Square, which is currently serviced by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/bus/routes/?route=64&#34;&gt;64&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/bus/routes/?route=64&#34;&gt;68&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/bus/routes/?route=85&#34;&gt;85&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/bus/routes/?route=CT2&#34;&gt;CT2&lt;/a&gt; along with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.charlesrivertma.org/ezride-shuttle/&#34;&gt;EZRide&lt;/a&gt; service (free with MIT student ID!) and a whole slew of tour and shuttle buses. A high-amenity heated bus terminal underneath Volpe with a walkway to the Red Line station would increase the neighborhood&amp;rsquo;s capacity for buses and improve the experience of riding the bus to Kendall, in turn increasing the neighborhood&amp;rsquo;s commuter capacity. For instance, a version of the CT2 that ran between Kendall and the Longwood Medical Area with higher frequencies and had all-day service might be a tempting alternative for Longwood-bound commuters taking the Red Line to the Green Line or riding the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.masco.org/lma-shuttles/m2-cambridge-hms&#34;&gt;MASCO-operated M2 Longwood shuttle&lt;/a&gt;. It would also provide an ideal launching point for an MBTA-operated circulator bus running between Kendall and the soon-to-be-rebuilt Lechmere station, which itself is a major bus hub and will &amp;ldquo;soon&amp;rdquo; be the confluence of the Green Line Extension&amp;rsquo;s two branches. If this bus were run down Third St. or First St. frequently enough, it would be a useful connection between Kendall Square and East Cambridge/Somerville that will be lacking even after the GLX is complete.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class=&#34;img-large&#34;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://yelling-at-trains.org/images/kendall-sketch.png&#34; alt=&#34;A possible(?) footprint of an undergound Kendall bus terminal&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s more, new access points to the Kendall station north of Broadway would extend the walkshed and overall influence of the station on the area. To give one example, a marked Red Line entrance on the northeast corner of the Volpe parcel would roughly half the outdoor walk distance to the IBM building on Binney St; another entrance on the southwest side would do the same for Akamai. Because the Kendall station is located on the southern extreme of what we think of as Kendall Square, the area feels dreadfully underserved by transit; moving the epicenter of the station complex would change that while improving many people&amp;rsquo;s walking commutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the day will come when we need to build another rail line into Kendall Square&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:6-Actually-it-s&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:6-Actually-it-s&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Will it be a Green Line branch along the Grand Junction with an insertion into Lechmere? A deep-bore Blue Line extension into Cambridgeport? We just don&amp;rsquo;t know where our needs or indeed tunneling technology will be in a decade or two when the political will comes trundling along, but I&amp;rsquo;m willing to bet we&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to have pre-excavated 1,000 ft or so of underground right-of-way parallel to the existing Red Line station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;6-build-upwards&#34;&gt;6. Build upwards&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we&amp;rsquo;re all singing Kumbaya over here, MIT is scratching its head trying to figure out how to make its $750 million back. The great thing about the Kendall area is that it&amp;rsquo;s one of the few places in the Boston area deemed far enough from Logan Airport for the FAA to permit a 1,000 foot tall building. This is a world of difference from the current Cambridge zoning restriction that caps it around 300 feet, so I doubt that this is on MIT&amp;rsquo;s list of serious alternatives, and it probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be. A skyscraper megaproject would preclude a lot of more incremental work that could be done on the parcel and totally obliviate the Red Line&amp;rsquo;s ability to handle Kendall Square&amp;rsquo;s traffic, essentially tying the project to a commitment from the MBTA and MassDOT for a new rail line through Kendall.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://yelling-at-trains.org/images/good-one.gif&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Still, though&amp;hellip;the ability to build tall in Kendall is tempting, not just because tall buildings are cool but because we can put a lot more cool things in them, like grocery stores and makerspaces and housing and presumably a few penthouses for absent Saudi oil barons to recoup the cost. Since MIT has to replace the current Volpe building for the feds before doing anything else, we have some time to think about this, and I hope when the time comes to present a master plan it will include the new tallest building in Cambridge, maybe somewhere in the neighborhood of 500-600 feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is a lot to ask, but I know the Institute is up to the task of building Kendall forwards and upwards while also embracing its humanity. Since this is a listicle about MIT, items 7-10 are left as an exercise for the reader. Thanks for stopping by!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Are transit networks strong-link or weak-link systems?</title>
      <link>http://yelling-at-trains.org/post/strong-weak-transit/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Do the people who plan your city&amp;rsquo;s transit system watch basketball or soccer? It&amp;rsquo;s a question that probably doesn&amp;rsquo;t come up much at community feedback meetings, and yet when we look at the way money is spent on transit in America, it might be wise to pause for a second and consider what sports metaphors are rattling around the brains of the planning community.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; On the surface, basketball and soccer may appear to be just two variants of sportsball, in which a group of people work hard to put some kind of ball in some kind of net more times than their opponent. And yet because of the geometry of each game is so different, building a winning team means different things for each sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malcolm Gladwell discusses the difference on his &lt;a href=&#34;http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/06-my-little-hundred-million&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revisionist History&lt;/em&gt; podcast&lt;/a&gt; by introducing dichotomy between what he calls &amp;ldquo;strong-link&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;weak-link&amp;rdquo; systems. Basketball is a strong-link system because the performance of a team can depend mostly on its superstar players, who can singlehandedly dominate the court. Soccer, by contrast, is weak-link, and the success or failure of a soccer team lies with its &lt;em&gt;weakest&lt;/em&gt; players. While a basketball court is compact enough that players can and regularly do score points on a drive without assistance from their teammates&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, the size of a soccer field dictates that most goals are preceded by a half-dozen well-executed passes getting someone in position to score, and &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; player needs to be able to competently fight for their own swathe of the field &amp;ndash; one weak link is enough to break an offense.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://yelling-at-trains.org/images/space-jam.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Pictured: the source of most of my basketball knowledge&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
        Pictured: the source of most of my basketball knowledge
        
            
        
        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While I am not here to seriously defend Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s analysis of sports, I do think the notion of strong-link and weak-link systems gives us an interesting lens through which to examine transit systems and the decisions made when planning them. In particular, I believe we are trying to build strong-link systems in places better served by weak-link thinking; if you allow me to stretch my metaphor right up to the breaking point, we are setting Steph Curry and a rec-league basketball team loose on a soccer field. This will mostly be a defense of weak-link thinking in transit, but not to the utter exclusion of strong links. Instead, as we will see, there is a time and a place for both, and successful transit planning hinges on knowing what kind of system to build in your time and place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To shoehorn transit systems into the strong/weak link analogy, consider why different services or lines in a transit network are less or more effective, and how they interact &amp;mdash; soccer players pass the ball around, transit services pass passengers around. As a baseline, I&amp;rsquo;m picking metrics that are pretty central to accepted wisdom about transit but I invite you to BYOM, as it were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequency:&lt;/strong&gt; how long do you usually have to wait to get a ride?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; how many people can we fit through this route per unit time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed:&lt;/strong&gt; how fast do routes in the system run, and how do they compare to other available modes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transfer quality:&lt;/strong&gt; how many transfers must one make to complete a trip in the system? Are transfers haphazard or coordinated, seamless or nerve-wracking?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amenities:&lt;/strong&gt; how clean, safe, and overall nice is the system to use? What information about the system is available and in what form? What concessions does it make to people with disabilities?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coverage:&lt;/strong&gt; what fraction of the people in a region have access to the transit system, conditioned on the frequency, throughput, and speed of the coverage the service they can access? Humoring me for a second, given &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;P(\vec{d})&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;Q(\vec{d})&lt;/span&gt; which describe the population and quality of service, respectively, at location &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;\vec{d}&lt;/span&gt;, what is &lt;span class=&#34;katex&#34;&gt;\iint P(\vec{d})Q(\vec{d}) dA&lt;/span&gt; over the whole system?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these metrics in mind, let&amp;rsquo;s imagine that we are allocated a limited amount of money to make improvements to an existing system (shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be hard), and we are to approach its design from both a strong-link and weak-link perspective. How would the planning process differ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To build a strong-link system&lt;/strong&gt;, the planning community would amass huge amounts of capital in providing top-tier service on a few select routes. No expense would be spared in making this service high-capacity, frequent, and fast. These routes would also use the best vehicles and large, amenity-rich stations. We might be generous in assuming that the planners pick some really good routes to focus on, but even so it is inevitable that this concentration of effort will be of little benefit to most people who use the system. While a lucky few riders speed in and out of the city on gleaming light rail trains, an unfortunate many find that there is nothing left in the budget to run an extra bus or two down their corridor during peak hours, or replace barren where-is-the-bus-don&amp;rsquo;t-ask-me-I&amp;rsquo;m-just-a-sign bus stops with safe, warm, and informative bus shelters. In short, the overall coverage of the system suffers. &lt;em&gt;A strong-link system is built for people unlikely to need to transfer&lt;/em&gt; because the transfer from a high-quality to a low-quality service will be drastic enough to bring down the overall experience of using the system, and fewer people will use it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://yelling-at-trains.org/images/strong-link-system.png&#34; alt=&#34;A strong-link system concentrates most of its resources into a few lines, resulting in weak connectivity between almost all destination pairs.&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To build a weak-link system&lt;/strong&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s important to make sure that even the lower-quality services meet some level of human decency, or the system won&amp;rsquo;t be able to function for anyone. This might be because the planners recognize that the kinds of trips good transit supports (commuting, errands, recreation, being unable to slow down because there&amp;rsquo;s a bomb under the bus) require strong transfers and good coverage that supports a wide range of destinations. In contrast to a strong-link system, therefore, such a system needs to be able to bring people to many different areas of the city, often using more than one vehicle per trip. In practice, this might look like incremental and across-the-board improvements to the city&amp;rsquo;s bus network &amp;mdash; &lt;a href=&#34;http://usa.streetsblog.org/2016/01/04/ridership-on-the-upswing-after-houstons-bus-network-redesign/&#34;&gt;defining more sensible routes&lt;/a&gt;, increasing frequency, and making modest amenity improvements, like adding small heated shelters with real-time information to stops. The bus isn&amp;rsquo;t rapid transit and it will probably never feel that way, but by clearly demarcating stops, improving frequency, and chipping away at travel time with signal priority and smart stop placement, we can afford to make pretty much everyone&amp;rsquo;s transit experience a bit better, especially those who actually rely on transit to get around.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://yelling-at-trains.org/images/weak-link-system.png&#34; alt=&#34;A weak-link system has few standouts, but provides reasonable service with strong transfers between many destinations.&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;this-could-be-us-but-you-playin&#34;&gt;This could be us but you playin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, confession time &amp;mdash; I am not entirely speaking in hypotheticals here. The dichotomy between strong-link and weak-link, to me, perfectly captures the difference between the transit system Metro Transit in the Twin Cities is building versus the one I believe it should. To be precise, the majority of the capital expenditure on transit in the region between 2014 and 2024 will be on building two light-rail lines which bypass dense and transit-dependent parts of Minneapolis in a mad dash to carry commuters in and out of the deep suburbs. Others, especially on &lt;a href=&#34;https://streets.mn&#34;&gt;streets.mn&lt;/a&gt;, have been beating this drum &lt;a href=&#34;https://streets.mn/2013/10/22/a-simplecomplicated-solution-to-the-southwest-corridor-situation/&#34;&gt;loudly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://streets.mn/2014/08/08/a-southwest-light-rail-explainer/&#34;&gt;much more skillfully&lt;/a&gt; for some time, but it suffices to say that although we are pouring large amounts of money into these projects, they are unlikely to serve the prime function of rapid transit, which is to move lots of people on all different types of trips, in a way that provides a new mobility alternative. We are building the strong-link system incarnate.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

    A nuanced critique of the Southwest LRT routing, with apologies to &lt;a href=&#39;https://www.facebook.com/webcomicname/&#39;&gt;Webcomic Name&lt;/a&gt; and I guess to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://metrocouncil.org/&#34;&gt;Met Council&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A weak-link perspective on what Metro Transit could be is encapsulated in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.metrotransit.org/abrt&#34;&gt;arterial bus rapid transit&lt;/a&gt; (aBRT) plan, which calls for modestly upgraded bus service on key corridors throughout the Twin Cities. This year the first of our hopefully many aBRT services opened along Snelling Avenue. Branded the A Line, it connects both light rail lines and provides ten-minute frequencies throughout the day. Ridership on this corridor is up 35% over last year, and it&amp;rsquo;s not hard to see why. We now have clearly demarcated stops with updated information about bus arrivals, pay-on-platform, and heating; the buses have signal preemption and (at least for now) a new car smell. Minneapolis-Saint Paul is said to struggle with a strong rail bias; people are much more willing to ride the strongest-link train than a weaker-link bus. I contend that the ridership improvement on Snelling visible just a few months after the A Line opened is proof enough that MSP transit users don&amp;rsquo;t have a rail bias &amp;mdash; we have a bias for reliable and comfortable service that respects us the way light rail does, even if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t go DING-DING-DING and shine lights in your face when it arrives. aBRT is how the bus should be everywhere, and it turns out we can probably build a ton of it for about $325 million&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2015/07/341-million-easy-way-how-southwest-light-rail-sort-got-its-budget-back-track&#34;&gt;about as much money as it costs to pick your nose arguing about bridges for a year&lt;/a&gt; instead of building light rail. Basically, we&amp;rsquo;d net the same number of new riders&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as either of our high-profile light rail projects for a fraction of the cost, and build a bunch of highly-visible bus infrastructure in our urban core.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-about-strong-links&#34;&gt;What about strong links?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as it strives to cast a wide net, a weak-link system need not be egalitarian to a fault. There are always going to be corridors that serve more people and deserve more attention, and these should be identified and prioritized. Nor does starting with a weak-link mindset preclude building rapid transit &amp;ndash; in fact, there is probably a stronger case to be made to the public for rapid transit when they already see the regular old buses serving people effectively all around the region than by asking taxpayers to cough up a few billion to squeeze latent demand out of the deep suburbs. For sustained and worthwhile investment in rapid transit, we first need a populace that sees the value in transit at all, and that means upgrading our bus network to first-world levels of service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But are there scenarios when it makes sense to take a truly strong-link perspective as a transit advocate? In other words, could it ever do more good to spend a fixed sum on a single corridor instead of spreading it out into the network at large? We rarely get to confront this question directly because of the complex nature of transit funding; with money pouring in from municipal, state, and federal levels and siloed into the budgets for specific projects, the choice is all too often &amp;ldquo;this or nothing&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;this or that&amp;rdquo;. Still, I think there are times when advocating for a strong link makes sense, especially as dictated by geography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some cities have highly linear density. Chicago butts right up against Lake Michigan with its downtown area and many universities and landmarks within a few blocks of the waterfront. This means that the north-south Red Line is an absolute workhorse for the city &amp;mdash; I know car-less residents who almost never have to use any other transit service in the city because it is so convenient. The Island Line in Hong Kong also serves a similar purpose for Hong Kong Island (which is by no means the entire city). Others still have a single geographic bottleneck that must be overcome, and the system depends on the existence of a link through that bottleneck. The Transbay Tube between SF and Oakland, and perhaps someday &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sfexaminer.com/think-tank-calls-for-second-bart-transbay-tube/&#34;&gt;Transbay Tube II: Electric Boogaloo&lt;/a&gt;, come to mind. These examples should be the guiding light for those fighting the good fight for single strong-link improvements like the cancelled &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/editorial/bs-md-hogan-transportation-20150624-story.html&#34;&gt;Red Line in Baltimore&lt;/a&gt; (RIP) and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.northsouthraillink.org/&#34;&gt;North-South Rail Link&lt;/a&gt; in Boston (pls). These are super worthwhile projects, and their advocates should (and largely do) seek to show the public the degree to which they can singlehandedly take the region&amp;rsquo;s transit infrastructure to another level.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://yelling-at-trains.org/images/baltimore-red-line.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The ill-fated Baltimore Red Line, which was rejected by Governor Larry Hogan in 2015.

        The ill-fated Baltimore Red Line, which was rejected by Governor Larry Hogan in 2015. Since our president-elect is a fan of infrastructure and the &amp;#39;inner cities&amp;#39; I am sure this one will be fast-tracked by the FTA any day now.
        
            
        
        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The key point is that strong-link planning seems to be most effective in areas that are compact and dense &amp;ndash; basketball courts, not soccer fields. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen time and time again in the United States that building a single high-quality rail line (or even several as Dallas has) through an otherwise car-dependent area will do little to change its urban fabric. Instead, I believe traditionally car-oriented cities should seek to quietly and incrementally improve the weak transit services they already have, building ridership as well as consciousness around transit even among those who don&amp;rsquo;t regularly use it. Appeasing the cruel mistress of transit funding often requires cohesive messaging and coalition-building, so these efforts need to be coordinated and branded under a single name as Metro Transit has done with aBRT. This unglamorous work will be rewarded when the time comes to start upgrading corridors to rapid transit, and planners and riders alike find that even a single LRT line can benefit from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect&#34;&gt;network effect&lt;/a&gt; of existing, reliable bus transfers rather than attempting to shoulder the region&amp;rsquo;s transit hopes on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Miracle&lt;/em&gt;, my favorite sports movie that is secretly an analogy for sound transit planning, coach Herb Brooks begs one of his star players not to try carrying the puck &amp;ldquo;coast to coast&amp;rdquo; and scoring on his own &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s a strategy that won&amp;rsquo;t work against the laser-focused teamwork of the Russian side. It&amp;rsquo;s only when the team strengthens their passing and formation fundamentals and galvanizes the link between every player on the ice that they begin to make progress. Building good transit in an auto-centric American city can feel like going up against the USSR in Olympic hockey, but the winning strategy is the same &amp;mdash; build the team, not the players, one pass at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;If the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mnrides.org/&#34;&gt;CTIB&lt;/a&gt; in the Twin Cities are Timberwolves fans it&amp;rsquo;s possible they&amp;rsquo;re doing the whole thing out of spite ðŸ¤”
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;I know this because have first-hand experience as that teammate.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;Ridership metrics may also mask some troubling realities of strong-link planning. If SWLRT does well (and I kind of expect it will) we will see 30-40k new riders introduced into the MT system because we spent $2bn wooing them out of their cars in suburbia. This 30-40k might be a significant fraction of the system&amp;rsquo;s overall ridership, and it looks so great on paper that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to lose track of the fact that this $2bn did basically nothing for the existing riders who may be heavily dependent on transit or at least much more committed to using it.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;Summing the cost estimates &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.metrotransit.org/Data/Sites/1/media/pdfs/atcs/ATCS%20Final%20Report.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the ten recommended corridors. Apply padding if you want, but the A Line was actually on budget.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:5&#34;&gt;I arrived at a first-order approximation of this number by summing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://streets.mn/2015/01/28/chart-of-the-day-top-10-metro-transit-bus-routes-by-ridership-2014/&#34;&gt;ridership of the busiest ten MT bus routes&lt;/a&gt; and assuming the 35% same ridership increase the A Line has seen in six months of operation. This matches closely with the estimates given by Metro Transit &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.metrotransit.org/Data/Sites/1/media/pdfs/atcs/ATCS%20Final%20Report.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and I will assert that given time and the network effect, a full-build aBRT system would bring closer to 50-60k marginal riders into the system.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time I have been very vocal about transportation issues to my very forgiving friends and family. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that rather than subject them to this madness directly I should start a blog &amp;ndash; this will also serve to help me practice writing clearly and organize my thoughts. I suspect this blog will mostly stay related to transit and urbanism since I spent so much time on the wonderful graphic in the header, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see what becomes of it. Welcome aboard!&lt;/p&gt;
